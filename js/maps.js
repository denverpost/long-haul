	1: '<strong>Segments 6-1:</strong> Breckenridge to Denver, 105 miles. The home stretch! I may resupply in Jefferson, on U.S. 285 here, or at Kenosha Pass. Although I&rsquo;ve only been from Breckenridge to Georgia Pass once, and that was on a mountain bike, I&rsquo;ve snowshoed and skied and run and biked and hiked all of the trails from Georgia Pass back to Denver, so this is familiar country. After climbing up and over Georgia Pass and then Kenosha Pass, the trail travels through amazing aspen and pine forest, including through the old Hayman fire burn area &mdash; a hot, dry, waterless chunk of trail. After crossing the North Fork of the South Platte River on the Gudy Gaskill bridge (hey, I&rsquo;m almost home), The Colorado Trail makes a short climb and then a short downhill that leads to the flat old road of Waterton Canyon and the northern terminus of the trail. Yahoo!',
	2: '<strong>Segments 10-7:</strong> Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, near Leadville, to Breckenridge. I&rsquo;m undecided about my resupply here. Tennessee Pass is a good place to meet someone. Leadville isn&rsquo;t terribly far away, but going there still eats up valuable time. With no resupply at the pass or in Leadville, the next feasible stop is Breckenridge, 72 miles away. Breckenridge sits right on The Colorado Trail. Although I&rsquo;ve been from Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, I&rsquo;ve not been through the country from there to Kokomo and Searle passes, and I&rsquo;ve not been from Searle Pass to Breckenridge, which involves a high crossing of the Ten Mile Range. The Holy Cross Wilderness is a beautiful highlight on this section, and the trail also passes through the old army training post, Camp Hale, where the 10th Mountain Division honed their skills during World War II.',
	3: '<strong>Segments 14-11:</strong> U.S. 50 to Twin Lakes is a 76-mile stretch that I originally had broken into two portions: one resupply at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs, which is right on The Colorado Trail, and another at Twin Lakes, the crossroad for all Colorado Trail and Continental Divide hikers. I&rsquo;ve combined this resupply into one drop at Twin Lakes. There&rsquo;s not much in Twin Lakes, but it&rsquo;s a bright-enough spot for a person that&rsquo;s been backpacking for awhile, and the general store will hold hiker packages. This stretch spends a lot of time in beautiful pine and aspen forests. It does make a steep ascent across the shoulder of Mt. Yale. Looking forward to a soak in the Mt. Princeton Hot Springs.',
	4: '<strong>Segments 21-15:</strong> Spring Creek Pass to U.S. 50. This is a long section, 105 miles, and the furthest distance between resupply points. There&rsquo;s simply nowhere to resupply, unless you walk to Creede (which is out of the way), or a friend resupplies by Jeep at Bear Town, a ghost town, or at the Eddiesville trailhead. This section is also one of the most beautiful on the entire Colorado Trail. The above-treeline expanse of Snow Mesa is one of the highlights and one of the most exposed places on the trail. The Colorado Trail also crosses the Durango/Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad tracks at Elk Park. The trail climbs up past the peaks of the Grenadier Range, paralleling Elk Creek to the divide, plunges down to Bear Town, crosses the Rio Grande and travels through the lowlands of the Cochetopa Hills before climbing up to Marshall Pass and U.S. 50 &hellip; where in my case, a friend will be waiting with a resupply box. Otherwise, with some planning, you could hitch a ride on the train to Silverton or Durango.',
	5: '<strong>Segments 24-22:</strong> From Molas Pass, The Colorado Trail travels 53.3 miles to Spring Creek Pass, through more wide-open country at high elevation. In these segments the trail crosses Coney Summit, which is over 13,000 feet and thus the highest point on the Colorado Trail. My resupply will be in Lake City; I&rsquo;ll hitch 17 miles on Colorado 149 to get there. I&rsquo;ve been over this section before, long ago, not long after The Colorado Trail was completed. What I remember most is that there weren&rsquo;t any other hikers in eight days of traveling. My other big memory is of one of the worst lightning storms I&rsquo;ve ever been caught in outdoors. Travel time: 3-4 days.',
	6: '<strong>Segments 28-25:</strong> This stretch goes from the start at Junction Creek in Durango and travels 73.9 miles to Molas Pass, on U.S. 550. My resupply will be at Little Molas Lake campground, or Silverton. It is a frontier for me &mdash; I&rsquo;ve not seen it in any of my previous Colorado Trail hikes. It climbs into the San Juan Mountains, above treeline. This stretch is high and exposed and I&rsquo;ll need to move fast to avoid storms. I won&rsquo;t have my trail legs yet, and pack organization will be sketchy for a few days. This is a country of big sweeping views and the flowers should be outrageously beautiful. I expect this stretch to take five days.',
	7: '<strong>Collegiate West:</strong> The Collegiate West trail is 80 miles long and was just completed in 2014. A high route along the Continental Divide. I&rsquo;ll probably walk this from Twin Lakes and go south, crossing Lake Creek on the bridge at the Little Willis Gulch Trailhead two miles west of Twin Lakes along Highway 82. Last year I lost a day trying to ford Lake Creek at &ldquo;the ford.&rdquo; The creek was in flood from all the rain and I spent a lot of time thrashing up and down along the bank trying to figure out a way across. Then a mountain biker told me about the bridge a couple of miles upstream. Duh. The trail climbs up Hope Pass &mdash; you hope you never have to carry a pack up it again &mdash; and then spills down Sheep Gulch. Then it climbs up Lake Ann Pass. And down Lake Ann Pass. Then up Cottonwood Pass&hellip; You get the picture. Up and down but mostly up. The trail crosses Cottonwood Pass and eventually ends at Highway 50. I&rsquo;ll need two resupplies here. One at the beginning, at Twin Lakes and one at the end, which will probably be in the grocery store in Salida after a hitch into town.'
