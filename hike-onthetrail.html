				<p class="published">Published September 10, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Collegiate West is a relatively new addition to The Colorado Trail. This 80-mile stretch roughly parallels the main route as it winds through the high, rugged terrain of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness north of Twin Lakes. Dean skipped ahead to this section of trail to cover its higher reaches before the snow sets in. He ran into few hikers until his friend Tom Brown joined him for the southern portion of the route.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Alone in the Collegiate Peaks: big country, big mental hurdles</h2>
				<p class="published">Published September 1, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Buena Vista &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a month on The Colorado Trail, I&rsquo;ve seen some things.</p>
				<p>I watched a leaping weasel chase a butterfly through a flower-speckled meadow. I&rsquo;ve listened to baby bighorn sheep baa-ing in their nursery high in the crags. I&rsquo;ve lunched with a moose, had an elk bed down near my tent, been serenaded by coyotes.</p>
				<p>I wake up excited for what each new day brings, and even when I&rsquo;m slogging up a muddy trail or another pass, I feel blessed.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>I listen to my body and my intuition. I know when to take the pack off and shelter up ahead of a rain. I find myself feeling the wind, studying clouds and the trail for moose (lots), cat (one) or bear (zero) tracks, and other humans. There were many until I skipped ahead to the Collegiate West. Now, there are few.</p>
				<p>A month in, I get into one of my resupply boxes and I wonder what idiot packed it. (Me!) I&rsquo;m not in love with some of the meals I thought I&rsquo;d be in love with when I was planned out my food. But all the gear has worked out.</p>
				<p>When the overnight rain drops were frozen on the tent one recent morning, well, that was a little scary. Winter&rsquo;s coming. A chain of friends got my heavy duty bivy bag and wind pants to me over the weekend. A good thing. The season for the rain kilt and lightweight mosquito bivy is over.</p>
				<p>Gear, cold, food &mdash; that&rsquo;s all manageable. The toughest thing has been going it alone.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Each section of The Colorado Trail has had it&rsquo;s own special challenges, but the Collegiate West has, so far, presented me with the most mental gymnastics.</p>
				<p>The Collegiates are my favorite mountain range in Colorado. They&rsquo;re just the way mountains should be: dense and steep, with sharp, craggy peaks that brush the sky and spear the clouds, with passes higher than the tallest mountains in many other ranges. There&rsquo;s running water everywhere. You don&rsquo;t cross streams on bridges on the Collegiate West. You ford them. And the woods and meadows are populated by all kinds of critters.</p>
				<p>The Collegiate West is a lonely place, in the way that a wild place should be lonely. I miss sharing things with someone else. There&rsquo;s no one to say, &ldquo;Hey, look at that!&rdquo; No one to discuss dinner decisions with. No one to make weather speculations with or to puzzle over strange forks in the trail with. There&rsquo;s no one to share in the misery of wet socks and wet shoes and a cold morning start. You get the picture.</p>
				<p>There used to be other hikers on the trail to socialize with and catch up on the news with. Not now. There&rsquo;s no one to ask about anything and no one to blame for anything. Just me. I&rsquo;m the only one out here.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Being alone it&rsquo;s hard to self-motivate, to get up and get going. Truthfully, some mornings I just want to lay wrapped in the warmth of the sleeping bag.</p>
				<p>Keep moving. That&rsquo;s my mantra, rain or shine, long or short, slow or fast. Keep moving. Except when it&rsquo;s time to nap.</p>
				<p>Not everyone that sets out from Denver to Durango or vice versa finishes the trail. When I land in a town, I hear news about people I met along the way leaving the trail. There&rsquo;s all kinds of obstacles on the trail, and not all of them of the wild variety. Blisters, dehydration, medical and family emergencies, cold, heat, burnout, loneliness, sickness. All take their toll on hikers.</p>
				<p>I give myself permission to turn back, to hike out to a road and take the big hitch back to Denver every day. And by doing so, I also give myself permission to go on.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Soothing the moose: Strange encounters on Snow Mesa</h2>
				<p class="published">Published August 25, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Gunnison &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> hiker came dancing out of the woods, face aglow, eyes shining. Like a mirage. Stopping in front of me she proceeded to stretch out one leg and then the other.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t used to need to do that when I was younger.&rdquo; </p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="large-12 large-centered medium-12 medium-centered small-12 columns">

								<p class="cutline">Snow Mesa, one of the most formidable passages on The Colorado Trail. The mesa is mostly above 12,000 feet. There is no shelter from the storms that seem to generate in a matter of minutes. <span class="photog">Dean Krakel, Special to The Denver Post</span></p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling any of this spritely love for the trail. I&rsquo;d had a hard time hitching a ride out of Lake City to the trailhead on Spring Creek Pass. I was starting up the foreboding Snow Mesa at 3 p.m., much later than I&rsquo;d intended. My pack was heavy with resupply, the trail was steep, it was hot and the biting flies were hungry. I felt like the Tin Man nervously approaching The Wizard of Oz.</p>
				<p>Snow Mesa had me intimidated. It&rsquo;s is a formidable piece of country, a high, treeless expanse, seven miles long and just as wide, all above 12,000 feet. The Mesa was all that stood between me and the comforting protection of the heavily forested La Garita Wilderness.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going up there this late, are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I am,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m feeling pretty insecure about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Naw, I wouldn&rsquo;t go. What I&rsquo;d do is take a siesta for a couple of hours, wake up, check it out. You do not want to be caught up there in a storm, and it looks like somethings brewing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down. I&rsquo;m in the trees. I made it across. I&rsquo;m a happy girl!&rdquo; With that she skipped away.</p>
				<p>OK, nap time. I rambled around in the woods until I found a nice flat place between two young pines to take a much needed siesta. But I took too long of a snooze. A rumble of thunder and raindrops woke me. It was getting dark, so I decided to stay put. I settled in and felt content. I was alone, out of the hustle and bustle of Lake City and back in the mountains, back on the trail!</p>
				<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Suddenly a tiny owl flew past my head, close enough to make me duck, then swooshed by again. And again. Then it lit on the branch of a fallen tree and we stared at each other, no more than 10 yards apart. Finally the owl must have grown weary of the game because it flew off into the night.</p>
				<p>That&rsquo;s when the rain began. A pouring, drenching deluge that ran in rivulets down through the pines, soaking my sleeping bag from the bottom up. Thunder rumbled and lightning streaked overhead. Not such a charming little bivouac now.</p>
				<p>When dawn came, the sky was clear. Throwing all my wet stuff into a garbage bag, I packed up and dashed toward Snow Mesa.</p>
				<p>In that crisp early morning light, with a big blue sky stretching out overhead, Snow Mesa was one of the most beautiful places on The Colorado Trail. So huge, so green, so sprinkled with flowers, I wanted to throw off my pack, take off my shoes and run across its lush carpet out of sheer joy.</p>

				<p>By 10 a.m. a few clouds had puffed up overhead. Nice cotton balls. No worries! Larger clouds loomed over the mountains in the distance. The day was young yet! I stopped and had a late breakfast, emptied my pack and spread everything out in the sun to dry. Soon, according to the map, I&rsquo;d be in trees.</p>
				<p>But Snow Mesa can be deceptive. Across the main mesa, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of above-treeline to navigate, and wide-open tundra saddles to climb and descend. And it was while I was walking up one of those saddles that the wind came up. A big wind.</p>
				<p>Suddenly the sky turned grey and my whole body hummed with alarm. I began moving as fast as I could, breathing like Darth Vader, heart hammering in my chest. Topping the last saddle I spotted trees below. Trees! I practically ran to them, trekking poles clicking off the rocks ahead of me for balance, the sky bubbling wickedly overhead.</p>
				<p>A crack of thunder overhead nearly drove me to the ground just as I hit the timber. The sky opened up. I stopped just long enough to pull out my umbrella and then I moved as fast as I could, jumping under the boughs of the first tree that I could fit under. The sky was dumping buckets. It began hailing. I hadn&rsquo;t even had time to take my pack off and dig out my rain gear, and I was getting soaked despite the umbrella and the pine boughs overhead.</p>

				<p>I must have felt that I was being watched, because I decided to look back over my right shoulder. Not 20 paces away stood a cow moose, her sleek brown coat wet and shining. A tiny calf sheltered under her bulk, wobbling on unsteady hooves. The calf couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a few days old. Uh oh.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey baby,&rdquo; I said in my calmest, coolest moose-soothing voice.</p>
				<p>The cow watched me intently, nostrils expanding and contracting as she breathed. OK. Lightning, rain and hail, or a disturbed mama moose?</p>
				<p>I stepped out into the rain and scurried further down the trail until I found a flat spot, an old camp, big enough that I could throw off my pack, pull out the tent, which dang, had just dried, finally. I pitched the tent, threw everything but my metal poles inside, zipped it up tight, squatted on my insulated ground pad and let the storm rage all around me for the next two hours.</p>
				<p>Sometimes it sounded as if I was underneath a jet airplane. The wind roared, the rain and hail pounded, the ground shook and the tent flapped and rattled, but I was happy. I was in the trees! I was among things taller than me! I&rsquo;d made it across Snow Mesa. I was done with the nerve-wracking tundra walking.</p>
				<p>Or so I thought.</p>

				<p class="dateline">Spring Creek Pass, Lake City &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ikers call it the &ldquo;30-mile tundra,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful and feared sections of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>Segments 22-24 stretch along the spine of the San Juan Mountains from Molas Pass to San Luis Pass (for northbound hikers, like me) &mdash; a lot of mileage. Fifty miles, if you add it up, but people call it 30. You can&rsquo;t get any higher or wilder in Colorado than the Continental Divide. You&rsquo;re rolling along between 12,000 and 13,000 feet for days at a time and up there, in the boiling storm clouds hovering in the peaks. Up there is where the lightning god lives. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. There are no trees. There is no cover. You are the tallest thing in the boulder-pocked green. You are the lightning rod.</p>
				<p>All the way up the crazy-steep climb along roaring Elk Creek to its headwaters on the Divide, in the rains and the mists ghosting among the peaks and lush forests of the Weminuche Wilderness, I kept asking other hikers I met about what was ahead, what was it like up there, how did they handle it, and the answer was always the same: something along the lines of, &ldquo;dude, we got lucky.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We ran 20 miles,&rdquo; said Rafikki, who was hiking with Wildflower and Breeze. &ldquo;We got a window in the weather and we went for it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; said Steamer with a shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything about it. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do. Find some low depression and wait it out and hope it&rsquo;s not your time I guess.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Not comforting. Not comforting at all. My mind was racing as I toiled up the trail under a heavy  load &mdash; because I&rsquo;d just resupplied in Silverton, and it had rained all night the night before, and I&rsquo;d packed the tent and the rain fly wet in the interest of speed. </p>
				<p>By the time I finished the final million switchbacks to the Divide I had pretty well inventoried everything that could possibly go wrong. It&rsquo;s well known that to avoid death by lightning in the Colorado high country, you get up and off the top by noon, because storms usually happen later in the day &mdash; usually. OK. But what if you couldn&rsquo;t get up and down by noon? What if when you got to the top, that&rsquo;s all there is? And what if you have to be on top for days? And what if you were carrying lots of metal: hiking poles, tent poles, stakes, umbrella, the eyelets in my gaiters, African bracelet, knife. Fillings. Sheesh. I was practically a metal magnet. </p>
				<p>So I&rsquo;d worked myself into a good state by the time I reached the top, at 12,000 feet. Wind-whipped clouds swirled above me and all around. On every horizon were clouds of every description and temperament: wind shredded wisps and mare&rsquo;s tails, black and grey thunderheads, white cotton puff balls. Storms flickered across distant peaks. I pulled down the hood of my rain shell so I could hear better. What was that? Thunder? No, a high flying jet. Was that a high flying jet? No. It&rsquo;s thunder. Distant. But still. Thunder is thunder.</p>
				<p>And so I began walking. Fast. Always studying the sky. Always looking for a low depression I could squeeze into. A place among the rocks where I wasn&rsquo;t the highest point in the landscape. A ravine I could sprint down. A cliff I could jump off. Yikes! It was nerve-wracking. I thought about turning back. I don&rsquo;t have to do this. I thought about the lightning storm I was in last year while I was doing the Collegiate East and West trails, how I threw off my pack and tossed my poles away from me and squatted on my haunches while the storm raged overhead and I, who do not pray, was moved to prayer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be such a better person. I&rsquo;ll be so good. I&rsquo;ll turn a new leaf. I&rsquo;ll give money to hospitals and orphanages and the homeless. Just let me through this one please.&rdquo; And I thought about Pounce and Helicopter, two Continental Divide hikers who&rsquo;d been caught in the same storm, only much higher, on Hope Pass. By the time they reached their resupply in the tiny town of Twin Lakes, Colorado, Pounce was in tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve walked all the way from Mexico. I just want to go to Canada,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;</p>

				</div>
				<p>After a time that first day I began to relax. I couldn&rsquo;t remain in such a high state of vigilance, so aware, all my senses humming at full alert. I started to enjoy the flowers. I stopped to take pictures of the clouds. I studied the rocks. I looked at elk tracks and laughed at the goofy marmots who always seemed to be caught napping along the sides of the trail. The tall rock cairns built as trail markers became a strange sort of company, like rock people, a sign not only showing the way but a sign that others had been here. Many others. A lot of others before me, and so far as I knew, not one of them had died in that high, lonely environment.</p>
				<p>That night, with my tent pitched next to a tiny stream trickling out of a snowbank, was the first time in my Colorado Trail journey that I had no cellphone coverage. Before then I&rsquo;d been able to turn my phone on at night and reach out and touch people to let them know I was alright. Now, for the next eight days I would have no contact. I was truly on my own. Alone. And it felt good.</p>
				<p>While I was Silverton, during my resupply I called Laine Walter, blind hiker Trevor Thomas&rsquo;s friend and supporter. We were chatting away, I was sorting out food and feeling lazy, like maybe I could spend another zero day just hanging out, when suddenly Laine blurted out. &ldquo;You have to move. You have to take whatever window of opportunity opens and you have to go with it. You have to keep moving. That&rsquo;s the name of the game in long-distance hiking. Move, Dean!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I thought about those words over and over again in the 30-mile-tundra. I learned how eat breakfast, doctor my blisters and pack my tent from the inside out. I learned to pack and separate wet gear, and when was a good time to stop and dry all that gear. I learned when was a good time to nap or rest or eat. What clouds to watch. What winds to keep track of. I learned how to be my own best company. But most of all I learned how to move, and how to keep moving no matter what the weather was doing, or how I felt about things.</p>
				<p>And that is how I got across the 30-mile-tunda.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Some thru-hikers counted on Animas River for water</h2>
				<p class="published">Published August 13, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Jenn Fields</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ean called from Lake City on Wednesday afternoon with updates from his trek across what Colorado Trail hikers call the 30-Mile Tundra. (We&rsquo;ll have a longer post from Dean on that soon.)</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, after Dean departed from Silverton last week, he crossed the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28595759/animas-river-contaminated-by-1-million-gallons-contaminated">Animas River shortly after the mining-waste spill there</a> via a bridge on the trail. He described the river as &ldquo;red&rdquo; when he came upon it and was alarmed to see another backpacker filtering water from the river.</p>
				<p>Another Colorado Trail thru-hiker told Dean that she&rsquo;d been counting on the Animas as a water source and broke down in tears when she came upon the orange-colored river, which <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28629387/colo-state-health-dept-says-animas-water-ok">the EPA now says is safe for drinking water treatment facilities</a>.</p>

				<p class="dateline">Silverton &mdash;</p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> load of backpackers in the bed of a pickup yelled and waved their hiking poles at me as I walked up the main drag this afternoon. People I&rsquo;ve met on the trail? Maleck, Jet,  Captain Yams or Woolly Booger? Maybe Bojangles or Mercury? Not sure. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the general &ldquo;yahoo!&rdquo; feeling of Colorado Trail energy that has infused this part of the state.</p>
				<p>Hikers are everywhere. On the trail, I meet at least a dozen fellow Colorado Trail travelers every day, except for the one day I didn&rsquo;t meet anyone. Off the trail, they&rsquo;re walking the streets in Durango and Silverton, Salida and Buena Vista, standing by the highway with their thumbs out, turning their pockets inside out at the grocery stores, slamming down cold beers in the bars and wolfing down steaks and burgers in the restaurants.</p>
				<p>Andy Hanahan III, owner of the Prospector Motel, where I stayed in Silverton, caters to hikers. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I cater to the hikers?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just look around. They&rsquo;re everywhere. The Colorado Trail has been a tremendous boon to towns like Silverton. I don&rsquo;t know why more businesses don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Hanahan takes resupply boxes, drives us to trailheads and the laundromat, does fresh coffee in the rooms. Fresh coffee, not packets, in his in-room coffee makers! He knows hikers crave the fresh buna. I know I did. One of the things I forgot to pack was coffee.</p>
				<p>Um, yeah. All that planning and no coffee. It was on my mind. But like a lot of things in the final haste to just get moving and out on the trail, coffee got left behind. Haste also cost me $169 for speeding outside of Montrose. &ldquo;But sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on The Colorado Trail in the morning. I have to get to Durango.&rdquo; Officer didn&rsquo;t think that was much of an excuse. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have broken the law,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>So how has it gone, this first week, aside from forgetting the coffee and getting a speeding ticket? A first week of backpacking is always a shakedown. I do believe that hikers starting their trip in Denver have a bit of advantage: a slower, lower start, a nice rolling trail for 70 miles before it starts the first real climb up Georgia Pass. Starting from Durango, at 6,512 feet in elevation, you begin climbing immediately and you don&rsquo;t stop until you get over the fierce, frighteningly beautiful Indian Trail Ridge at 12,338 feet.</p>
				<p>The pack is getting organized. I can&rsquo;t find things in the tent at night. I&rsquo;m still gaining my trail legs and lungs. But I&rsquo;m much stronger than last year. Much. I&rsquo;m not bounding like a bighorn up the trail just yet, but all the high-mileage hikers I meet assure me that in time that will come. Yeah! Until then, I&rsquo;m a 10-mile-a-day guy. Fast or slow, I go 10 miles. My mornings (I&rsquo;m on the trail by 7 a.m.) start out fabulous and degenerate by afternoon. And I think some of that is due to nutrition. </p>
				<p>Yup. The subject I devoted the most time and planning to has turned out to be the most flawed. I blame pemmican.</p>
				<div class="row">

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The pemmican I had such high hopes for &mdash; it was supposed to be breakfast and lunch, I made 24 pounds of the stuff over the winter, it was going to be my go-to energy source, my miracle food) &mdash; is a bust. The truth is, when all was said and done, I just can&rsquo;t eat it steady and straight. Pemmican is wonderful when thrown into boiling water and mixed with macaroni in the evening. A calorie bomb. But on it&rsquo;s own? Give me peanut butter and cheese and eggs.</p>
				<p>A hard confession. I am, after all, the Pemmican God of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>The other thing about pemmican is that in bear country &hellip; well, pemmican is meat and fat, and hey, bears are all about meat and fat. If you&rsquo;re a mountain man with a Hawkins rifle you can guard your pemmican. But me? I had a bear walk through my camp one night and all I had was my umbrella. While it&rsquo;s true that bears are scared to death of umbrellas, I don&rsquo;t want to make a habit of testing the limits of the power of the umbrella. So I&rsquo;m leaving the pemmican behind here in Silverton.</p>
				<p>Pemmican isn&rsquo;t taking all the blame here &mdash; I expected to make more distance than I am. For the next section of trail, the 53 miles from Molas Pass to Spring Creek Pass, I had budgeted food for three-and-a-half days. When my former wife Alisa (who has graciously done my Lake City to Salida resupply) reminded me that it took us eight days to do that stretch back in the &rsquo;90s, and that there is a lot of climbing involved, I just laughed it off. Ha, ha, ha. I am nearly two decades older now, but hey, so much stronger! Right. After a week on the trail, I thought better of that three-and-a-half-day estimation, and that&rsquo;s why I headed into Silverton to buy food. I am beefing up that resupply to seven days of food, including a layover day, and I&rsquo;m fortifying my resupplies in a likewise manner all along my route.</p>
				<p>All the equipment has worked out. I had my doubts about the rain kilt, especially when it was storming so hard as I came up Kennebec Pass that rain was blowing up my cuben fiber skirt. But hey, how often does that happen? In a straight, steady downpour it works, but I do miss my long rain pants. Maybe it&rsquo;s a guy thing. The umbrella? Priceless. Not only does it shed rain, it acts as a windbreak. I curled up behind it beneath a pine once and slept out a storm. And it&rsquo;s been storming a lot. The last night before I hitched into Silverton, camped above Hotel Draw, was the first night in a week without thunder and rain. Storms forced me to do a zero day &mdash; no miles &mdash; last Sunday beneath Indian Trail Ridge. One gust of wind on Sunday night shook the tent so hard that I thought a moose (there were tracks in the trail) was assaulting me. Everybody knows moose hate tents. Right? </p>
				<p>So it&rsquo;s been shakedown and shake-it-up and get-in-tune week. But what&rsquo;s the trail like? I am surrounded by fantastic scenery every minute of every day. On the rainy, cloudy days, mist blows like smoke across the mountain peaks. On the sunny days the skies are the deepest, purest blue.The flowers are like being inside a kaleidoscope. Despite the blisters (I have two), I love moving through this landscape. I feel happy and alive and grateful. And I&rsquo;ve met some wonderful people. Everyone I meet is going south, and this far south, they are close to the end of their Colorado Trail trip, and they are glowing and wild eyed and filled with the good energy of the mountains.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t&rsquo;s been hurry-up-and-wait mode on The Colorado Trail for a few days.</p>
				<p>This morning, Dean headed out under somewhat clear skies to dash across the exposed Indian Trail Ridge in Segment 27.</p>
				<p>With the San Juans somewhat socked in over the weekend, Dean got stuck high on the trail waiting for storms to clear out enough for safe crossing through this above-treeline section of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>Here&rsquo;s an Aug. 1 update from Dean:</p>
				<p><i>Storms have me stalled out between Kennebec Pass and Indian Trail Ridge. The ridge is a narrow, long passage, and a storm magnet, and another big climb. I was up at 5:30 a.m. hoping to miss the rain, but by the time I got to the top at 11,700, it was raining so hard and blowing so bad that rain was blowing up the rain kilt, and I had to hold tight on the umbrella. So I made an early camp.</i></p>
				<p><i>I had to dry things out. My feet are so wet they&rsquo;re wrinkled as if I&rsquo;ve been swimming. And now I&rsquo;m going to cook something hot. Thank you, Mr. Stove. Breathtaking scenery. I&rsquo;m also charging the phone. Legs are good but tired today.</i></p>
				<p>He reported in early Aug. 2:</p>
				<p><i>Stayin&rsquo; put. It&rsquo;s ugly out already. Sounds like a distant bombardment.</i></p>
				<p>Early on Aug. 3, he sent a sunny trail photo and said:</p>
				<p><i>I&rsquo;m on the move.</i></p>
				<p>A couple of hours later, he posted on <a href="https://instagram.com/p/57Vze-h23l/">Instagram that he&rsquo;d made it across</a>.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he minute you start thinking about thru-hiking the trail, you have to start thinking about resupply. Your resupply determines what kind of food you&rsquo;re going to make, how durable it is, how long it lasts. Then you have to decide whether to mail resupply boxes or drop them off yourself &mdash; that&rsquo;s what I chose to do, because you can&rsquo;t mail butane canisters.</p>
				<p>Calculating the food you take on the trail and your resupplies has to be done carefully. Are you going to arrive at a resupply empty? That&rsquo;s my goal. For the longer stretches between towns and resupplies, I hope I&rsquo;ve figured that right.</p> 
				<p>Here&rsquo;s my resupply plan &mdash; and remember I&rsquo;m starting in Durango &mdash; with some trail description along the way.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 28-25:</span> This stretch goes from the start at Junction Creek in Durango and travels 73.9 miles to Molas Pass, on U.S. 550. My resupply will be at Little Molas Lake campground, or Silverton. It is a frontier for me &mdash; I&rsquo;ve not seen it in any of my previous Colorado Trail hikes. It climbs into the San Juan Mountains, above treeline. This stretch is high and exposed and I&rsquo;ll need to move fast to avoid storms. I won&rsquo;t have my trail legs yet, and pack organization will be sketchy for a few days. This is a country of big sweeping views and the flowers should be outrageously beautiful. I expect this stretch to take five days.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 24-22:</span> From Molas Pass, The Colorado Trail travels 53.3 miles to Spring Creek Pass, through more wide-open country at high elevation. In these segments the trail crosses Coney Summit, which is over 13,000 feet and thus the highest point on the Colorado Trail. My resupply will be in Lake City; I&rsquo;ll hitch 17 miles on Colorado 149 to get there. I&rsquo;ve been over this section before, long ago, not long after The Colorado Trail was completed. What I remember most is that there weren&rsquo;t any other hikers in eight days of traveling. My other big memory is of one of the worst lightning storms I&rsquo;ve ever been caught in outdoors. Travel time: 3-4 days.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 21-15:</span> Spring Creek Pass to U.S. 50. This is a long section, 105 miles, and the furthest distance between resupply points. There&rsquo;s simply nowhere to resupply, unless you walk to Creede (which is out of the way), or a friend resupplies by Jeep at Bear Town, a ghost town, or at the Eddiesville trailhead. This section is also one of the most beautiful on the entire Colorado Trail. The above-treeline expanse of Snow Mesa is one of the highlights and one of the most exposed places on the trail. The Colorado Trail also crosses the Durango/Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad tracks at Elk Park. The trail climbs up past the peaks of the Grenadier Range, paralleling Elk Creek to the divide, plunges down to Bear Town, crosses the Rio Grande and travels through the lowlands of the Cochetopa Hills before climbing up to Marshall Pass and U.S. 50 &hellip; where in my case, a friend will be waiting with a resupply box. Otherwise, with some planning, you could hitch a ride on the train to Silverton or Durango.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 14-11:</span> U.S. 50 to Twin Lakes is a 76-mile stretch that I originally had broken into two portions: one resupply at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs, which is right on The Colorado Trail, and another at Twin Lakes, the crossroad for all Colorado Trail and Continental Divide hikers. I&rsquo;ve combined this resupply into one drop at Twin Lakes. There&rsquo;s not much in Twin Lakes, but it&rsquo;s a bright-enough spot for a person that&rsquo;s been backpacking for awhile, and the general store will hold hiker packages. This stretch spends a lot of time in beautiful pine and aspen forests. It does make a steep ascent across the shoulder of Mt. Yale. Looking forward to a soak in the Mt. Princeton Hot Springs.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Collegiate West:</span> The Collegiate West trail is 80 miles long and was just completed in 2014. A high route along the Continental Divide. I&rsquo;ll probably walk this from Twin Lakes and go south, crossing Lake Creek on the bridge at the Little Willis Gulch Trailhead two miles west of Twin Lakes along Highway 82. Last year I lost a day trying to ford Lake Creek at &ldquo;the ford.&rdquo; The creek was in flood from all the rain and I spent a lot of time thrashing up and down along the bank trying to figure out a way across. Then a mountain biker told me about the bridge a couple of miles upstream. Duh. The trail climbs up Hope Pass &mdash; you hope you never have to carry a pack up it again &mdash; and then spills down Sheep Gulch. Then it climbs up Lake Ann Pass. And down Lake Ann Pass. Then up Cottonwood Pass&hellip; You get the picture. Up and down but mostly up. The trail crosses Cottonwood Pass and eventually ends at Highway 50. I&rsquo;ll need two resupplies here. One at the beginning, at Twin Lakes and one at the end, which will probably be in the grocery store in Salida after a hitch into town.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 10-7:</span> Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, near Leadville, to Breckenridge. I&rsquo;m undecided about my resupply here. Tennessee Pass is a good place to meet someone. Leadville isn&rsquo;t terribly far away, but going there still eats up valuable time. With no resupply at the pass or in Leadville, the next feasible stop is Breckenridge, 72 miles away. Breckenridge sits right on The Colorado Trail. Although I&rsquo;ve been from Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, I&rsquo;ve not been through the country from there to Kokomo and Searle passes, and I&rsquo;ve not been from Searle Pass to Breckenridge, which involves a high crossing of the Ten Mile Range. The Holy Cross Wilderness is a beautiful highlight on this section, and the trail also passes through the old army training post, Camp Hale, where the 10th Mountain Division honed their skills during World War II.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 6-1:</span> Breckenridge to Denver, 105 miles. The home stretch! I may resupply in Jefferson, on U.S. 285 here, or at Kenosha Pass. Although I&rsquo;ve only been from Breckenridge to Georgia Pass once, and that was on a mountain bike, I&rsquo;ve snowshoed and skied and run and biked and hiked all of the trails from Georgia Pass back to Denver, so this is familiar country. After climbing up and over Georgia Pass and then Kenosha Pass, the trail travels through amazing aspen and pine forest, including through the old Hayman fire burn area &mdash; a hot, dry, waterless chunk of trail. After crossing the North Fork of the South Platte River on the Gudy Gaskill bridge (hey, I&rsquo;m almost home), The Colorado Trail makes a short climb and then a short downhill that leads to the flat old road of Waterton Canyon and the northern terminus of the trail.
