				</div>				
				<p>A fellow hiker asked me if I was still peeing outside at night.</p> 
				<p>Um &hellip; yeah. I am.</p>
				<p>A few weeks after leaving The Colorado Trail, I think about it every day. I long to be out there. Walking. Unpacking the pack and putting gear away has been a form of closure. It&rsquo;s also given me an opportunity to think about what I&rsquo;ll do different next time.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Food</h3>
				<p>I won&rsquo;t attempt to make all my own backpacking food again. All winter long, the Krakel Ranch bustled with preparations for the trail. By spring, I&rsquo;d produced 24 pounds of pemmican &mdash; that light-weight, calorie-dense combination of meat and fat that I was going to rock the trail with &mdash; along with homemade energy bars, pinole cookies and dehydrated berries, beans and noodles.</p>
				<p>The reality is, on the trail I ate very little of the food I manufactured.</p>
				<p>Pemmican dropped into the cook pot and mixed with freeze-dried meals created a nutritious calorie bomb. But inside my pack, pemmican melted into a greasy, smelly mush in the summer heat. Plus, I began thinking of it as a bear attractant, which was a disturbing thought. But the main thing was, after eating several pounds of pemmican, I wasn&rsquo;t in love with the taste.</p>
				<p>My taste in other trail foods changed dramatically, too. I quickly tired of the homemade energy bars I&rsquo;d packed in my resupply boxes and ended up buying KIND and Pro Bars whenever I was in towns. At home I created meals of rice, chicken, beans and eggs. But on the trail I favored stroganoff, macaroni and pasta. (I will never eat another freeze-dried egg meal.)</p>
				<p>I started buying other things in town: Epic and Tanka bison bars, rather than processed jerky. Tuna and salmon, in the foil packets. And cheese, which is heavy, but I never tired of it.  </p>
				<p>Cooking oatmeal for breakfast quickly got old. I preferred Justin&rsquo;s almond butter and a Vega protein shake instead. I did use the instant oatmeal I packed, as a snack, pouring it directly into my mouth as I walked. You can&rsquo;t get much more instant than that.</p>
				<p>Amazingly, I didn&rsquo;t miss coffee on the trail, and I didn&rsquo;t take candy &hellip; but I was always happy when someone packing caffeine and Snickers bars joined me.</p>
				<p>Whatever calorie deficit I had on the trail I made up for when I was in town. &ldquo;That humongous cheeseburger comes with a choice of three sides, which would you like?&rdquo; &ldquo;All three and another Moose Drool, please.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Since I ended up not eating most of the food I mailed to myself, next time around I won&rsquo;t use resupply boxes. I&rsquo;ll hitch into town and shop at grocery stores.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Training</h3>
				<p>Last November, I began seriously training for The Colorado Trail. I hired personal trainer Shawn Austin of Body By Emilee to whip me into shape. Austin, who is a rock climber, distance runner and former Outward Bound instructor, created workouts that elevated my heart rate and created strength, stability and balance, which is especially important for ankles. I did a lot of stair sprints. Instead of running on the local trails as usual, I walked them carrying a heavily weighted backpack.</p>
				<p>Training for the trail not only strengthened my body and made it more injury resistant, it also strengthened my mind. The discipline required for training pays off when you crawl out of the tent and begin climbing yet another saddle, yet another ridge. If you&rsquo;ve been humping a sandbag over hill and dale in rain, snow, darkness and heat, walking up a mountain is just like another training day. Just as important was the confidence I had in my leg and lung power to get the job done.</p>
				<p>I attribute Austin&rsquo;s good training to the fact that I never suffered during my trip, never felt wiped out at day&rsquo;s end, never had any aches, pains or soreness &mdash; until I took that fall while running on Seale Pass. Chances are, without good conditioning I would have gotten more banged up.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Solo hiking</h3>
				<p>For me the hardest thing about walking The Colorado Trail was going solo. Being alone has its advantages, and I enjoyed it. Sometimes, though, I had to make decisions or walk in places and through situations that I dearly wished I could talk to someone else about. And there&rsquo;s the whole sharing the experience thing as well. At times it would have been nice to have had company.</p>
				<p>But for the most part, The Colorado Trail isn&rsquo;t a lonely place. There are other hikers. Towns are close. Navigation is easy. But still, when it came right down to it, I was alone much of the time, and being alone, making a mistake, even a simple one, can result in serious complications. As one hiker said to me, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re alone, things can get real, real fast.&rdquo; Hiking solo I was more cautious, methodical and thoughtful about consequences.</p>

				<p>The true secret to hiking alone is comfort. Being comfortable with your skill level and the environment you&rsquo;re in, comfortable with who you are and what your limitations are. But the most important thing is, you&rsquo;ve got to be comfortable being by yourself, being your own best company and counsel.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Gear</h3>
				<p>One of my goals was to travel The Colorado Trail as lightly as possible. I did pretty well with that. </p>
				<p>A Zpacks Arc Blast 52L backpack, 23 ounces, carried everything. I liked the Blast&rsquo;s simplicity and minimalist, low-profile design; it handled loads under 30 pounds well. I had two pouches sewn on each side of the waist belt in which I carried my camera, spare batteries, SD cards, reporter&rsquo;s notebook (with the cardboard covers removed) and a pen. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>When emptied my pack at the end of my Colorado Trail Journey, this is what else was in it:</p>
				<p>In the pack&rsquo;s right side pocket I carried The Colorado Trail Data book and a euroSCHIRM Liteflex swing umbrella. The umbrella kept the rain off and the wind out in a storm. I sheltered up behind the umbrella many times in passing squalls. The other side pocket held a water bottle. </p>
				<p>On back of the Blast is a large netting compartment. This is where I carried items I used frequently or needed to get to quickly:</p>
				<p>&#9642; Black Diamond Cosmo headlamp</p>
				<p>&#9642; Sunscreen</p>
				<p>&#9642; Plastic orange whistle</p>
				<p>&#9642; Sawyer PointOne Squeeze water purification filter and three 34-ounce Sawyer water bags</p>
				<p>&#9642; Potable Aqua water purification tablets in a ziplock bag, in case of filter failure</p>
				<p>&#9642; Two Bic lighters</p>
				<p>&#9642; Two small eye-dropper bottles of Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s soap and Purell</p>
				<p>&#9642; Bandana</p>
				<p>&#9642; Bodyglide anti-chafe lubricant. I used Body Glide &mdash; removed from the container and carried in a plastic bag &mdash; religiously on my feet every morning.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Small Swiss Army knife</p>
				<p>&#9642; Black Diamond polartec glove liners</p>
				<p>&#9642; Halo skullcap</p>
				<p>&#9642; A cuben-fiber stuff sack with my medical/blister/repair kit: one small tube arnica, medical tape, Spenco 2nd Skin blister pads, Dr. Scholl&rsquo;s corn pads and Moleskin, a small ziplock of merino sheep wool (excellent padding for hot spots and blisters), one gauze sponge, Benadryl, Ibuprofen, Cephalexin (for infection), Kaopectate, toothbrush and toothpaste, a safety pin, triple antibiotic ointment, various band aids, tent/tarp repair tape, a tent pole splint (with that and duct tape I fixed a broken pack frame), three spare lighters, spare AAA batteries, a CORSAR &mdash; Colorado Search and Rescue &mdash; card, a credit card and some cash. The bag weighed 12 ounces.  </p>
				<p>&#9642; Pack rain cover</p>
				<p>&#9642; Light My Fire spork</p>
				<p>&#9642; Rab Flashpoint wind/rain/snow shell. This 6-ounce wonder held up under every condition and kept me dry and warm.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Outdoor Research wind/rain pants, 9.63 ounces. I wore these for sun protection when needed.</p>
				<p>&#9642; A pair of socks. I liked Darn Tough Light Hiker Quarter socks and I used three pair, wearing one, keeping one in the net for a quick change, and the other in the pack for reserve.  </p>
				<p>&#9642; Raven feather, which I found on the trail the first day and carried all the way home. </p>
				<p>Inside the pack, bottom to top:</p>
				<p>&#9642; NRS neoprene socks for wet, cold conditions</p>
				<p>&#9642; Western Mountaineering 10 degree Versalite down bag, 2 pounds. Awesome bag! This bag kept me toasty warm even when I slept outside without a shelter. I used an Outdoor Research compression bag to pack it down to the size of a fat loaf of bread.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Sport Silks by Terramar, 3.12 ounces.  I wore the silks beneath the North Face running shorts I wore 100 percent of the time. I rolled the legs of the silk underwear up above my knees, like a knicker, and could easily unroll them to cover my legs as the temperature dropped or the wind came up.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Patagonia capilene zip-neck long underwear top</p>
				<p>&#9642; Patagonia R1 fleece hoody. I didn&rsquo;t wear the fleece but a few times but having it gave me peace of mind.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Montbell ultralight down jacket. I used this jacket relentlessly every day. At night it was my pillow.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Long sleeve REI Sahara Tech shirt for sun, wind and bug protection. My everyday shirt was a short sleeve Kuhl Renegade.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Mountain Laurel Designs 3.3-ounce titanium cook pot</p>
				<p>&#9642; MSR Pocket Rocket stove. 3 ounces</p>
				<p>&#9642; One 13-ounce MSR Isopro butane fuel canister</p>
				<p>&#9642; Zpacks 6.4-ounce Splash Bivy</p>
				<p>&#9642; A nylon ground cloth made from tent flooring, 5 ounces</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>				
				<p>&#9642; Zpacks 7-foot-by-9-foot rectangle tarp, with additional tie-out points and cords, 11 ounces. After I got the hang of it, I could set the tarp up reasonably fast and make it storm-proof. I used rocks around the edges to really batten it down when needed. Maybe I should have carried more stakes. This is a big tarp for one person, but I could get my pack and all my gear inside, plus get dressed underneath it, and cook inside the front opening.</p>
				<p>&#9642; 12 MSR groundhog tent stakes</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>&#9642; A Zpacks Rain Kilt, 4 ounces. I used this a lot during the summer rains. During the fall it added warmth when worn over the wind pants and helped me stay dry walking through wet grass and willows.</p>
				<p>&#9642; Thermarest Zlite sleeping pad</p>
				<p>&#9642; A garbage bag. I used this to separate wet stuff from dry, and for food storage at night. Speaking of which, I carried my food in scent-proof bags. At night I placed these bags inside the garbage bag and then placed the garbage bag inside my pack. I slept with my food.</p>
				<p>&#9642; To charge my phone and Garmin 910XT watch, I used a RavPower portable charger. The charger held enough juice to charge my phone six times and weighed 11.4 ounces, total weight with various cords, 1 pound, 2 ounces.</p>
				<p>And that&rsquo;s what I carried. Total weight, with five days of food, but no water, was 22 pounds, 4 ounces.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Other gear</h3>
				<p>I used an Olympus TG-4 point and shoot camera. Water, dust, freeze and drop proof, and evidently Dean proof, I carried this camera in my shirt pocket for 11 weeks and was always amazed by the quality of images it was capable of producing. Battery life was excellent. One battery lasted a week or longer; I carried four extras. The TG-4 also had the ability to create a wifi hotspot anywhere, allowing me to transfer images from the camera to my iPhone for editing and sending back to the blog.</p>
				<p>I wore Saucony Peregrine 5 trail running shoes, a size larger than what I normally wear. Peregrines have incredible traction on every type of terrain. No complaints, even minor, about them. I wore out three pair. Inside the shoes, green Superfeet insoles.</p>
				<p>In addition to the Zpacks tarp, I used two other shelters during the trip: a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 tent, 2 pounds, and a Big Agnes Scout UL2 tarp tent, 2 pounds. I weathered storms in the San Juans in the Fly Creek; it was the tent I most often saw other hikers carrying. The Scout, a combination of both tent and tarp, was easy to set up and turned storms and combined all the best features of both worlds. It was well-vented, and I liked having a tarp with a floor and a door. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>During the first half of my trip, I used an Enlightened Equipment Revelation down quilt, 20 ounces. The quilt took some getting used to; I slept in my down sweater and long underwear to aid in additional coverage and warmth. I never slept cold &hellip; until that frigid morning at Tank Seven Creek, when I decided I needed a warmer bag.</p>

				<p>Winter had been nipping at my heels all the way from the Tenmile Range. Although I had hiked most of the trail without pains or aches, now a blister was hatching on my right foot, and I felt tweaks in my left achilles and knee that worried me. If the shoulder and rib injuries from my fall on Searle Pass worsened, well, that could put an end to things, too. I wasn&rsquo;t the big dog for pain that I thought I was.</p>
				<p>When I&rsquo;d topped out on Georgia Pass on Oct. 5, I&rsquo;d felt a happiness that moved me to tears. Georgia was a familiar place, and the last big pass standing between me and my home in Conifer. The wind was blowing hard and the tears were mingling with snowflakes and sleet on my face. I couldn&rsquo;t tell which was which. The trail had stripped me down, brought emotions close to the surface, left my soul as transparent as a mica flake.</p>
				<p>The next morning in my camp near Deadman Creek on the west side of Kenosha Pass I awoke in so much pain I was forced to make a tough decision. I couldn&rsquo;t go on the way things were. I needed to leave the trail and spend some time healing. But if I left, would I really be able to come back. What if the comforts of home proved too seductive or winter arrived with a vengeance in my absence.</p>
				<p>But a week later I was back on the trail with a smile on my face, going down the east side of Kenosha Pass. The last 70 miles of The Colorado Trail was in front of me. It was warm, warm enough for shorts! For the first time since falling, I could hold a hiking pole in my left hand and take deep breaths without wincing. I was carrying a light pack over easy, rolling terrain, kicking up dry leaves with every step, gazing skyward to a golden aspen canopy and cloudless blue.</p>
				<p>I was going to make it.</p>
				<p>Kenosha Pass, the Lost Creek Wilderness, the Buffalo Creek burn &mdash; I&rsquo;d imagined that these final sections of trail would be interesting. But they were more than that. They were some of the most beautiful, lonely and joyful passages on my journey. Magical miles.</p>
				<p>In the Lost Creek Wilderness, the summits of the Kenosha Mountains are knobby, brooding summits reaching up to 12,000 feet and extending for more than 30 miles. The meadows are piled with granite boulders and domes and filled with aspen and pine groves. Lost Creek itself pours down through a wide, pine-framed meadow afire with the reds and yellows of willows and tall grasses in early October, and the muddy banks of  beaver ponds are tracked up by deer, elk and small critters of all kinds. And there was more mountain lion scat in the trail through the Lost Creek Wilderness than I&rsquo;d ever seen in my life, which added to the wildness.</p>
				<p>Every now and then I&rsquo;d look back and see blue silhouettes of mountains on the horizon and think about how far I&rsquo;d come, from beyond those mountains and the mountains beyond them, from the far southwest corner of the state.</p>
				<p>It was too much to comprehend. That high, raw alpine world of steep-sided peaks, summer wildflowers, snowfields, expanses of tundra and streams falling in torrents seemed like a distant planet I&rsquo;d visited ages ago.</p>

				<p>Sometimes as I walked I&rsquo;d try and remember all of my camps. I could remember the rain camp on the first night out of Canyon Creek, the big storm camp beneath Indian Trail Ridge, my bear camp near Hotel Draw, lightning camp at Hancock Lake, the full moon at Camp Hale. But in two and a half months on the trail, most had become a blur. There were so many blanks in my memory, I gave up playing that game.</p>
				<p>I thought I&rsquo;d be able to figure my life out on the trail. The past. The future. What happens next. Somewhere along the way, I thought there would be a moment of satori, what Buddhists call a realization of one&rsquo;s true nature. A pine tree would burst into flame and a thunderous voice would boom, &ldquo;Hey Deano, here&rsquo;s the big plan.&rdquo; Never happened. By the time I reached Lost Creek, I&rsquo;d pretty much thought about everything there was to think about until I couldn&rsquo;t think about those things anymore and I had come to the realization that there was nothing I could do about any of it, anyway.</p>
				<p>With all the mental and physical fat burned away &mdash; I&rsquo;d lost nearly 15 pounds &mdash; and not enough food left to be distracted by snacking, I became a guy just walking the trail. Walking guy decided to spend the remainder of the journey being mindful and present. That was my satori, not a flaming pine tree and booming voice. A light pack and an enlightened mind. Something like that.</p>
				<p>Time and miles flowed by. I was astounded to find myself walking a 3 mile-per-hour pace. Yet there was still time to take photographs, linger by springs and creeks, study animal tracks and scat, listen to the squirrels and birds, goof around and nap.</p>
				<p>I rolled right through the Rolling Creek Trailhead into segment 3 and camped among the Ponderosa pines, on a soft bed of pine needles and kinnickinnic. It&rsquo;s interesting, camping in familiar country I&rsquo;d only seen during the daytime as a mountain biker or running man. Now I was drinking from tiny streams I&rsquo;d splashed thoughtlessly through before and seeing things I&rsquo;d never really paid attention to.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>A friend from Conifer hiked in to meet me at the tail end of that stretch, and as we walked we talked about life changes over the past few months. She helped me locate a beer another friend had stashed for me (&ldquo;go past the gate with the &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; sign, find a tree with a pink ribbon around it, then look beside the fallen log nearby&rdquo;) and drove me to the firehouse to get water from the spigot in back.</p>
				<p>People have asked me whether after being alone for so long I minded having company on the trail. Friends and family joining me for a segment or a few miles wasn&rsquo;t an intrusion. It was support and love. This Colorado Trail trip wasn&rsquo;t just about miles and scenery. Whatever experience the trail provided had become the journey.</p>
				<p>Before light the next morning, I entered the Buffalo Creek burn and watched the sun come up over that surreal landscape, miles and miles of burned trees standing ghostlike in the pale light. A controlled fire to the southeast provided a smoky mist, adding to the haunted effect.</p>
				<p>I feel a deep connection with the burn. I&rsquo;d been a photographer at the Rocky Mountain News when the fires and floods raged in 1996. Later, my wife and our boys often mountain biked on The Colorado Trail there, and when I&rsquo;d visited the burn in my other life, before walking The Colorado Trail, all I saw was a devastation, a post-fire endpoint that saddened me.</p>
				<p>Walking in the big mountains I had felt small and insignificant. The geologic scale and the cataclysmic events that had shaped things was staggering. But it was also in the distant past. Hiking through the burn was like walking through an open wound. I felt close to the raw, brute force of nature and the striving desire of living things to burst forth. Far from a dead zone, the burn was full of life, regrowth and color.</p>
				<p>By leaving my job and all the precious things in my life behind to walk The Colorado Trail, I had, in a way, created my own personal forest fire. The act of walking sometimes felt like an internal burn. I&rsquo;d like to think that a new me will rise out of the ashes, but like the Buffalo Creek burn, it&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s still evolving. And it&rsquo;ll take some time to see just exactly what comes forth.</p>
				<p>That night, I camped under the stars on a grassy hump below the burn. In the morning after an eleven week, 500-plus mile hike through the Colorado mountains, I&rsquo;d walk down the switchbacks to the South Platte River, cross the Gudy Gaskill bridge, turn up the North Fork Trail and walk home. But as I laid awake staring into the night sky, I didn&rsquo;t think of the ending of things. I thought about how grateful I was to be lying beneath the pines and stars one more time, listening to the river with the big, wild world stretching out around me. And in that moment, that was all I needed.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ean Krakel completed his thru-hike of The Colorado Trail on the evening of Oct. 15, 2015. </p>
				<p>Dean has been hiking the trail from south to north. Since he lives in Conifer, he exited the trail near Reynolds Park and walked home via the North Fork Trail rather than hiking segment 1, which connects to the Front Range at Roxborough State Park. (The trail is currently closed in Waterton Canyon in segment 1, anyway.) </p>
				<p>Does it seem like he&rsquo;d been out there for a while? He was. Dean began his journey on Aug. 1 in Durango. He&rsquo;s gone through three pairs of shoes and climbed more than 100,000 feet during the course of his hike. He&rsquo;s walked well over 500 miles, through storms, heat and snow. With a dog bite. With bruised ribs and a beat-up shoulder. While all this is a testament to his physical and psychological endurance on the trail, what&rsquo;s most remarkable to me, his editor, is that he penned most of his columns from the trail during one-hour-limit stints at library computers in mountain towns.</p>
				<p>And he&rsquo;s not done! He&rsquo;s not done writing, that is. We&rsquo;ve discussed at least two more stories with him about his last days on the trail and the challenges of ending a big journey. Check back for more stories from the trail soon, including a video documentary from Denver Post videographer Mahala Gaylord.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">The perfect hitch, and the best resupply stops</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Oct. 14, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Frisco &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or thru-hikers, getting to town is a huge thing. Town is where the coffee, cheeseburger and shower gods live. Getting from town back to the trail is another huge thing. And hitching is how I (and most hikers) get back and forth to resupply and then get back on the trail.</p>
				<p>While hiking The Colorado Trail this season, I&rsquo;ve hitched to and from: Silverton, Durango, Lake City, Gunnison, Salida, Buena Vista, Crested Butte, Frisco, Breckenridge, Mount Princeton Hot Springs, Leadville, Cottonwood Pass, Monarch Pass, Colorado 114, Durango, Hotel Draw, Molas Pass. Some of them, many times.</p>
				<p>Resupplying on backpacking trips is new to me. In the past, if I backpacked for two weeks, I carried two weeks supply of food on my back. But there&rsquo;s no point in carrying pounds and pounds of food when I can cut weight by restocking from a grocery store or picking up a general delivery package at the post office.</p>
				<p>The downside: hitching to town requires time and patience. You have to wait along the road, usually out in the middle of nowhere, for a ride.</p>

				<p>Conversations about hitching among hikers mainly revolve around how hard or easy the hitch is. But I think it&rsquo;s a matter of serendipity and karma. Hitchers and hitchees have something to give each other, and usually it&rsquo;s more than just a ride.</p>
				<p>Strangers can be totally candid with one another. A woman who picked me up in Gunnison was trying to decide whether to quit her job or not and pursue some life-long dreams. Having just left my job to walk The Colorado Trail I probably wasn&rsquo;t the best person for her to talk to. Or maybe I was.</p>
				<p>Lake City was the hardest hitch I&rsquo;ve had. Many drivers slowed down enough to tell me they were only going a short ways, otherwise they&rsquo;d give me a lift. It took nearly an hour standing on the edge of town before a guy servicing backcountry yurts picked me up.</p>
				<p>Gunnison was the second hardest. I spent a long, hot morning attempting to hitch out of town. Finally, a guy pulled over, told me I was standing in the wrong place and took me to the right place &mdash; in front of the Walmart, where I was picked up within minutes and delivered to Crested Butte.</p>
				<p>The easiest hitches were Buena Vista and Salida. Stand anywhere along U.S. 285 or 50 with your pack and someone is going to pick you up.</p>
				<p>The absolute best hitch I&rsquo;ve had so far, in fact the most nearly perfect hitch I&rsquo;ve had, went like this.</p>
				<p>My friend Tom had come out to hike the final 40 miles of the Collegiate West trail with me. We&rsquo;d left his car on Cottonwood Pass and now we were walking the final miles along Monarch Ridge to U.S. 50. The sky had been threatening rain all day. We&rsquo;d just popped out onto the highway and had no more than stuck our thumbs out when a fireman from Gunnison whipped off the road and popped open his trunk. We&rsquo;d just gotten into his car when a pouring rain started.</p>
				<p>The fireman took us to the parking area in front of the Monarch Crest store on top of Monarch Pass. The rain stopped. Five minutes later, a woman who&rsquo;d been hiking the nearby Crest Trail picked us up. She had been unemployed for a long time but had recently gone back to school and reinvented herself as a software designer. She drove us all the way to the post office in Salida, where I had a resupply box waiting.</p>
				<p>Picking up my box at the post office, one of the people waiting in line struck up a conversation. He and his girlfriend, both ultrarunners, wanted to run The Colorado Trail. He bought us coffee, then took us out of town to U.S. 285 to hitch a ride to Buena Vista.</p>
				<p>Our coffee was still steaming as a traveling hospice nurse stopped and waved us into her car. It&rsquo;d started to rain by then, and we did look pretty pathetic standing there with our packs, my cardboard resupply box rapidly getting soaked.</p>
				<p>As she drove us to Buena Vista, I asked her what the most important thing was that she&rsquo;d learned from her patients.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Forgiveness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Forgiveness, and that the dying thought the living were wasting precious time.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The nurse took us as far as her house, which just happened to be on the road going to Cottonwood Pass. We&rsquo;d no more than unloaded from her car when a red pickup pulled over.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can take you as far as the hot springs,&rdquo; the driver said. &ldquo;Jump in back.&rdquo; And so we did.</p>
				<p>One of the most important things I&rsquo;ve learned about hitching: No distance is too short. Any forward momentum is good.</p>
				<p>At Cottonwood Hot Springs, we waited just a few minutes. An elk hunting guide on his way over the pass stopped and welcomed us to hop into his SUV. He was late to his camp &mdash; dinner was waiting! &mdash; and he drove fast up the pass while we talked about elk, and their amazing vision, and the prehistoric hunting pits Tom and I had seen that morning on the Continental Divide.</p>
				<p>All of this, and in just under two hours, we&rsquo;d been deposited at Tom&rsquo;s car on the top of Cottonwood Pass.</p>
				<p>That&rsquo;s what I call a perfect hitch.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<h3 class="subheading">Ghost&rsquo;s best of hitching towns:</h3>

				<p><strong>Cheeseburger:</strong> The Packer burger at the Packer Saloon and Cannibal Grill, Lake City. The Gunnisack in Gunnison serves up a pretty tasty burger as well.</p>
				<p><strong>Beer and a bite:</strong> Eddyline Brewery and Restaurant in Buena Vista. They serve their own brews here and the food is delicious. Giant salads. You don&rsquo;t get those on the trail.</p>
				<p><strong>Motel:</strong> The Prospector Motel in Silverton. Real coffee in the rooms, delivery to the trailhead when you&rsquo;re ready and they take resupply boxes. And the price is right: $40 bucks a night.</p>
				<p><strong>Grocery store:</strong> The High Country Market in Lake City. Big selection of hiker foods, fresh produce, a great deli and other supplies. They even have a sign on the door: Hiker Trash Welcome Here. Pete, one of the owners, takes hiker boxes and goes out of his way to be helpful.</p>
				<p><strong>Library:</strong> Silverton. Located in a cool old historic building with a chill, dog-friendly atmosphere and Mac computers. Runner-up: The library in Frisco has a huge selection of used paperback books for a buck. My worst library experience, by the way, was in Buena Vista. They have an hour limit, per person, per day and no exceptions, even if there&rsquo;s a fleet of computers not being used. </p>
				<p><strong>Best outdoor shop:</strong> The Trailhead in Buena Vista. They have everything, well most everything, a hiker could need in the way of supplies, and the staff is very helpful. Salida Mountain Sports in Salida is also good, but it has more clothing than backpacking supplies.</p>
				<p><strong>Best coffee shops:</strong> The Roastery in Buena Vista. A laid-back place with good food. It&rsquo;s OK to linger here; I spent hours writing at The Roastery. The Mocha Moose in Lake City is also excellent, with a great burrito and homemade salsa.</p>
				<p><strong>Best breakfast burrito:</strong> The Butterhorn Bakery and Cafe in Frisco. Huge breakfast burrito, endless coffee refills.  </p>
				<p><strong>Best public transportation:</strong> Summit County&rsquo;s free buses run all the time and go everywhere: service to Frisco, Leadville, Breckenridge, Silverthorne and Dillon.</p>
				<p><strong>Best post office:</strong> Salida. Friendly, helpful staff who go out of their way to help hikers with problem shipments.</p>
				<p><strong>Best barbershop:</strong> Floyd&rsquo;s in Salida. Small, colorful, eccentric and reasonably priced. Reon, the barber, is a perfectionist and a lively conversationalist.</p>
				<p><strong>Best resupply stops:</strong> The store at the Molas Lake Campground holds dozens of hiker resupply boxes and the folks there know the country well. They even called me when I didn&rsquo;t pick up my box and took it to Silverton Town Hall so I could pick it up after the campground closed. The General Store in Twin Lakes is a crossroads for Colorado Trail and Continental Divide hikers, and a great place to hang out and catch up on trail news. The store is well stocked, and they have inexpensive hiker cabins. The historic Twin Lakes Inn across the street has cool rooms with downy, feathery beds, and the restaurant&rsquo;s elk meatloaf is most excellent!</p>
				<p><strong>Best hot springs:</strong> The hotpots down by Cottonwood Creek at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs.</p>
				<p><strong>Best hiker box (public boxes that hikers donate surplus supplies to):</strong> The Monarch Crest store. I was blown away by the amount of food and gear in that box.</p>
				<p><strong>Best unasked-for resupply treat:</strong> The Starbucks in Conifer held one of my resupply boxes as it was relayed from friend to friend and added a box of instant coffee to fuel my hike. Thank you!</p>
				<p><strong>Best resupplies way, way off the trail:</strong> Backcountry.com shipped me a new, warmer sleeping bag, after I placed the order via phone after a cold night while I was hitching for a ride on Colorado 114. Runner&rsquo;s Roost in Denver got me a new pair of trail shoes pronto when I trashed yet another pair.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Fear on the trail, real and imagined</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Oct. 8, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Conifer &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>ntil a few nights ago, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about mountain lions much as I walked The Colorado Trail. </p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for signs left by my forest neighbors &mdash; tracks and scat in the trail and around watering places. Always listening and looking for what the squirrels and jays are gossiping about, but usually it&rsquo;s about me. I&rsquo;ve seen one bear track in two and a half months and heard one bawling out in the woods. I did have a bear in camp one night, though by the time I got out of the sleeping bag, put my headlamp on and unzipped the tent door, that bear was gone. </p>
				<p>Lions I&rsquo;ve not seen or heard. Two hikers I talked to saw mountain lions, and both times it was in the Cochetopa Hills, and both times the cat was lazily stretched out across the trail and took off the minute it became aware of humans. </p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the big cats. I&rsquo;ve seen one mountain lion in my lifetime, and that was in my Conifer front yard. It was quick, lithe and beautiful. But that&rsquo;s plenty. My life list of mammals in that regard is complete.</p>

				</div>
				<p>One dark and stormy night last week, I was climbing up a ridge through deadfall and thick trees, looking for a place to camp. There hadn&rsquo;t been a flat space big enough to pitch the tarp for miles, not even a flat enough spot to stretch out in. Lightning was flashing in the distance and thunder was rumbling overhead. Every now and then the sky spit down frozen sleet. If there was nothing down low, I thought, there might be a flat spot up on top, hopefully sheltered by trees. </p>
				<p>It was growing dark, so I put my headlamp on and kept moving. The problem was, I wasn&rsquo;t moving very well. I&rsquo;d taken that tumble up on Searle Pass a few days before, and everything hurt. </p>
				<p>Although the rotator cuff in my left shoulder was the big concern, my whole left arm was pretty much useless, and my right shoulder had started acting up as well. Getting my pack on and off had become an ordeal involving tree stumps or boulders for props, rolling around on the ground and of course, cursing. My ribs ached every time I took a deep breath. My left knee was tweaked in the fall, too. I had to stop and rest often, more often than usual, to hunch over my one hiking pole and take light, non-hurtful breaths. </p>
				<p>Finally topping out on the ridge, I saw a nice looking campsite, but you know how it is: Hey, there may be something better around the next bend. So I sauntered on down the trail. Then I stopped cold. </p>
				<p>I had the weirdest sensation that I was being shadowed. My senses were tingling and the hair on the back of my neck was prickling. There was fresh bear scat full of berries in the trail at my feet, but that didn&rsquo;t bother me at all. Bears are curious but black bears aren&rsquo;t stalkers. </p>
				<p>No. Not bear. Something else. That was when my mind screamed, <i>lion!</i> Nothing attracts the attention of a predator like a weak or injured animal. And it was late evening, dinner time. I did a rapid fire review of everything I knew about a lion confrontation: I couldn&rsquo;t raise my arms overhead to make myself appear bigger. I couldn&rsquo;t easily drop my pack and yank out the umbrella, my strongest defense. My Swiss Army Knife was buried somewhere inside the pack. Running wouldn&rsquo;t be an option.</p>
				<p>I stopped. There was no way I was going around the next trail bend. Even if I&rsquo;d wanted too my feet wouldn&rsquo;t have moved me there. Every fiber of my being was humming on high alert. Caveman stuff.</p>
				<p>Now, the odds of something happening between man and beast on The Colorado Trail are very low, almost nonexistent. To my knowledge, no one has ever been killed or injured or even greatly hassled by any large critter in the whole history of the trail. Nor has anyone been killed by lightning on the trail, and lightning is a real and major danger. Falling trees haven&rsquo;t harmed anyone. </p>
				<p>Moose, for me, are the next most worrisome thing: Surprising a moose can be a really unfortunate experience. Bears are around but, like I said, in two and a half months I&rsquo;ve seen one track and mainly, bears just want you to go away. People ask me if I&rsquo;ve seen any bears and I always have to say no, but I&rsquo;ll bet lots of bears have seen me. Certainly they&rsquo;ve smelled me. And that&rsquo;s got to be scary for them.</p>
				<p>But mountain lions have killed people in Colorado and elsewhere. They&rsquo;re killing machines, and they speak to something deep down and dark in our very core.</p>

				</div>
				<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be culled from the herd, don&rsquo;t want to be the first person on The Colorado Trail to go down in that particular record book. I suspect I already hold the longest thru-hiking record. No addendums please. &ldquo;Oh, old Ghost. Yeah, he was slow. And he got mauled by a lion, too. Perhaps he should have been faster. Tisk, tisk, tisk.&rdquo; </p>
				<p>As quietly as possible, I began walking backwards. When I got to a wide spot in the trail, I whipped around and made my way back to that really great and now very appealing camping spot I&rsquo;d seen. I removed my pack as gently as possible while standing fully upright, no wincing or cussing, then opened it, dug out the tarp and set it up one-handed with much louder banging of rocks against the stakes than usual. </p>
				<p>See here, lion! Man, rock, metal, tool! Then I crawled inside, zippered it up and went to bed without supper.</p>
				<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a lion, but then, mostly, you never do. </p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m asked often if I get scared walking alone on The Colorado Trail. I have to say, that was the scariest experience I&rsquo;ve had. And I never saw anything tangible to fear. For the most part I don&rsquo;t think about everything that can go wrong on the trail, because lots can go wrong and we can&rsquo;t do anything about the majority of it. If you think about everything that can go wrong, and what there is to be afraid of, you won&rsquo;t ever take a step. </p>
				<p>The most dangerous thing in the woods are humans, and the most dangerous things that happen to humans on The Colorado Trail, we do to ourselves. Like <a href="#blog14">running up a pass in the near dark wearing a big pack</a>.</p>
				<p>I have bumped into one section hiker who was packing a huge handgun in a shoulder holster. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;For bears and cats and such,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>Packing a gun on the trail isn&rsquo;t the answer for me. A gun doesn&rsquo;t change the fear factor enough to make up for the weight, and when I&rsquo;m in the woods with a gun, I have an altered attitude. It&rsquo;s not the mindset I want to be in on the trail. I&rsquo;m out there as a fellow traveler, a visitor, an observer. I&rsquo;m out there as a humble pacifist, alert, watchful and respectful. </p>
				<p>But I do carry a big umbrella.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ough guy, right? Take a bad tumble on Searle Pass, leave the hospital emergency room in Frisco, put on the pack, get back on The Colorado Trail. Walk over the Tenmile Range to Kenosha Pass and get the remaining high mountain passes done before winter&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
				<p>Whoa. Not so fast pardner. And not so tough either.</p>
				<p>Not only were my left shoulder and arm smashed up (they got the worst of it), but also my right shoulder, my right upper ribs, left knee and left hand. Just putting on and taking off the pack got to be a ridiculous routine involving aid from stumps, boulders, logs and sloping ground, plus movement that would make a yoga master proud.</p>
				<p>In the past week, I had to execute those moves often, putting on and taking off the pack at least 20 times a day to eat, get clothing, drink water, check the data book. It was excruciatingly painful every time. Every single time. Plus, hurt ribs made it difficult to breathe, and the throbbing knee worried me.</p>
				<p>I have a high pain tolerance, but tolerating pain does not a fun Colorado Trail hike make. The grimace-to-grin factor was getting way out of balance. When I arrived at Kenosha Pass yesterday, I had the opportunity to get off the trail to go home for rest and healing. I took it.</p>
				<p>My own shower and bed felt pretty nice after two and a half months on the trail. And water out of a tap, and unlimited access to food? Sweet!</p>
				<p>But I won&rsquo;t be here long. I still have 70 miles to go, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to walking every mile.</p>

				<p class="dateline">Frisco &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, I was running up Searle Pass and had a little accident that caused a hospital visit in Frisco. Running. Up. Searle. Pass. Yes. In almost darkness no less. With a pack on. I guess I was feeling invincible because I&rsquo;ve been very lucky so far.</p>
				<p>Nine weeks on The Colorado Trail, and the worst thing that has happened was a dog bite on my right knuckle and one stubborn blister. No burns (campfire, stove or sun); no twisted ankles; no blown knees; no cuts; no bad water or food poisoning. Not even a sniffle or a groan. I haven&rsquo;t even been sore. Stiff, yes, but not sore.</p>
				<p>Monday afternoon was extraordinary. My friends Tom Brown &mdash; who walked the last half of the Collegiate West with me &mdash; and Max Young were hiking from Tennessee Pass to Copper Mountain with me. We&rsquo;d watched the Supermoon rise from Camp Hale the night before and howled at it, and were climbing up, up, up to Kokomo and Searle Passes through beautiful golden aspen groves.</p>
				<p>We were experiencing a rocking light show at 12,000 feet. Rain. Snow. Rainbows. Blazes of light breaking through gray and white cloud to dance across the tundra, shine upon the hard rock peaks of the Tenmile Range or touch upon fast-moving storms.</p>
				<p>I couldn&rsquo;t shoot my camera fast enough. An amazing landscape would unfold, I&rsquo;d take a picture or many and five minutes later that vision would be replaced by something even more wonderful.</p>
				<p>We&rsquo;d been moving steadily all day. As the daylight faded, we were busting hard for Searle Pass when the last five minutes of daylight cast a red glow on the highest peaks all around. I began to run.</p>
				<p>I felt like I was flying. I wasn&rsquo;t a backpacker anymore, I was a nimble and quick trail runner again. My heart was pounding with joy.</p>
				<p>Then my right shoe caught a rock. For a moment I thought I might recover. Momentum carried me a few yards, and then I slammed down so hard onto the trail I didn&rsquo;t even skid to a stop. Hmmmm. I laid there taking inventory. I knew I was lucky I hadn&rsquo;t hit my head, because the trail is infested with pointy rocks. Still had all my teeth. Blood was coming from my hands. Getting shakily to my feet, I saw that my wind shell and wind pants had holes in them from the rocks. The worst thing was my left arm hanging useless at my side. And the pain. Oh, baby! I opened and closed the fist of my left arm and nearly passed out.</p>
				<p>What really hurt was the thought that I may, through my momentary lapse of good judgment, have scripted a different ending to my trip than the one I had planned.</p>
				<p>You can&rsquo;t cry about things on the trail. No one&rsquo;s going to come save you. You have to keep moving.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, I had Max, a professional guide well-versed in wilderness medicine who poked and prodded me for broken or dislocated bones. And Tom, who knows just what to say in unfortunate circumstances like this. What Tom said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your poles. I&rsquo;ll put your headlamp on you. We need to move down.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>And so we did. We traveled late into the night, steadily down, Max in the lead, sweeping his headlamp light from side to side looking for a place to camp, and Tom behind me.</p>
				<p>Camp was a quick bivouac on a flat space among pines. No tents or tarps. That guaranteed that long about midnight it would began to rain. Thunder rumbled and lightning cracked across the sky just once.</p>
				<p>But still, we had to cover up as best as we could and as quickly as we could.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I thought while the rain was pelting my sleeping bag. &ldquo;Three weeks of blue sky and now, when I&rsquo;m laying out in the open with a messed-up arm &hellip; now it has to rain?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep most of that night, despite the pleasant numbing effect of whiskey. Massive doses of ibuprofen didn&rsquo;t take the edge off the pain.</p>
				<p>But sometime during the wee hours close to dawn, I moved my left arm, something popped and I blissfully passed out.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>In the morning, we hiked down to Copper Mountain then rode a shuttle bus to the hospital in Frisco, where I was questioned and X-rayed. What I love about mountain towns? Nobody in the hospital even questioned the bad judgment of running a high mountain pass. Of course! That&rsquo;s what we do in Colorado!</p>
				<p>The prognosis was that I had no broken bones and nothing was dislocated. Could be a rotator cuff issue, the doctor said. He prescribed a painkiller and said to give it two days. If it improved, good thing. If it got worse, then I&rsquo;d need an MRI and it would probably be game over.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can finish your hike with a rotator cuff problem, but it&rsquo;ll be challenging,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">450 miles, 90,000 feet up</h3>
								
				<p>The injury has made me think about what it will be like to stop moving eventually. I&rsquo;ve walked over 450 miles of the Colorado Trail and climbed more than 90,000 feet up and over passes and saddles and bridges and hills and divides all the way from Durango to Copper Mountain. I&rsquo;ve worn out three pairs of running shoes.</p>
				<p>What will it be like to not be climbing out of the sleeping bag and walking all the livelong day?</p>
				<p>What will it be like to not wake up to the noise of the forest, the calls of ravens and jays, the chittering of squirrels? What will it be like to lie between walls and listen to the sound of the wind and not hear the fabric of a tent or tarp flapping. I already have trouble sleeping in a bed on my resupply days off trail.</p>
				<p>Some things will be nice, of course. Turn a tap and presto, there&rsquo;s water! To live in a temperature-controlled environment. To hear the wind and not be out there in it, getting blown and buffeted and frozen and baked and wet. To not always be at the mercy of the weather, not studying the sky and looking at clouds with more than casual interest all the time. And toilets? What kind of magic is that?</p>
				<p>To make meals that are not created by boiling water or unwrapping foil or wrappers. To have more than one shirt and pair of running shorts at my disposal. To shower and shave and wear clean clothes every day. To be with family and friends and loved ones.</p>
				<p>So yeah, there is that. And of course there&rsquo;s the fact I left my job at The Denver Post to take this journey and wondering what&rsquo;s next in my work life.</p>
				<p>Truthfully, I don&rsquo;t think much about the future. There&rsquo;s too much in the present to be concerned with. Like the weather. Winter&rsquo;s coming. Take my mind off the trail and think about something and the next thing I know I&rsquo;m stumbling over a root or a rock.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>And there&rsquo;s so many other interesting things to see and think about. During the past week, I&rsquo;ve watched my third full moon rise above the mountains, listened to a noisy, scary bear brawl out in the woody darkness, heard bull elk bugling in the evenings.</p>
				<p>And I&rsquo;ve finally figured out the whole squirrel thing &hellip; but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m not traveling slowly because I&rsquo;m weak or out of shape, but by choice. The longer I&rsquo;ve been on the trail, the less important it has become to be hasty and the more important it has become to see and savor. I&rsquo;ll pass this way just once, so I&rsquo;m in no hurry. I&rsquo;ve no job waiting for me. No partner. No wife. No girlfriend. My boys are grown.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve still got 117 miles to go until I turn the door knob on the front door of my home in Conifer. A two-week, 100-mile backpacking trip is still a pretty formidable adventure, and, joyfully, that&rsquo;s ahead of me.</p>
				<p>Mainly, I feel blessed to still be out here on the trail. Taking that first step at Canyon Creek in Durango was scary. There was so much ahead of me and so much I didn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m a changed man now.</p>
				<p>I feel competent and comfortable in the woods in a way I&rsquo;ve never felt before. How that will translate in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world in front of me I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
				<p>What I do know is this: I&rsquo;m moving on. Snow is coming and I&rsquo;ve got two high passes to get over. This morning I dressed myself in under 30 minutes. I&rsquo;m getting some limited range of motion in the arm. With a light pack, a pocket full of pain pills and the blessings of the universe, I&rsquo;m good to go for the distance ahead.</p>
				<p>And as my friend Winston Caine reminded me: Having one arm never stopped The Fugitive.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>iking sections 19 through 17 of The Colorado Trail, from the crossing of Cochetopa Creek to Lujan Creek, was so far one of the hardest walks I&rsquo;ve had out here.</p>
				<p>Coming out of the San Juan mountains and hitting the high prairie was a shock. Once abundant, water is a challenge. True, this is Continental Divide country, but it&rsquo;s not the great, lofty parting of the waters. Rain doesn&rsquo;t appear to flow either to the Atlantic or the Pacific here. It just makes muddy puddles and evaporates. The springs are so small that water has to be dipped out one partial cup at a time.</p>
				<p>Here the mountains recede, replaced by hot, sagebrush- and grass-filled flatlands that stretch for miles in every direction. Trails degenerate into a mish-mash of rutted dirt roads. The high prairie&rsquo;s spaciousness had a special beauty, but mentally, I wasn&rsquo;t in a place that allowed me to accept and enjoy it.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;d suffered a dog bite in my right hand &mdash; a friendly hiker dog, just an accident &mdash; and although I&rsquo;d doctored the hand as best I could, it had swollen up. My knuckles disappeared, and it was painful to grip my hiking pole. I couldn&rsquo;t remember when I&rsquo;d had my last tetanus shot. So it was a huge relief for me to reach Colorado 114, the end of section 17 on my northbound journey, and hitch a ride off the trail to the clinic in Gunnison.</p>
				<p>Frankly, I had no intention of returning to finish the sections from the Cochetopa Hills over Sargents Mesa to Marshall Pass. I&rsquo;d had enough of the lowlands, of heat and road walks and sharing the trail with cows, jeeps, pickups, motorcycles and ATVs. I didn&rsquo;t want to worry about water anymore.</p>
				<p>But when it came time to load the pack again after I finished the Collegiate West, guilt did me in. If I was going to walk The Colorado Trail, then it couldn&rsquo;t be just the best of The Colorado Trail. I would have to walk all of it.</p>
				<p>Turns out Sargents Mesa and Marshall Pass were one of the pleasantest interludes of my journey. The last wildflowers of summer were in full bloom, the forests were a delightful, tangled mess of decaying fallen trees mixed with wild jumbles of new growth. I picked handful after handful of huckleberries, smashing them into my mouth as I walked until my lips were stained purple.</p>

				<p>Water wasn&rsquo;t plentiful, but it was available. Waiting for a small trickle to fill my cup at Razor Creek was as refreshing as a nap. Getting water led me to hike to Baldy Lake, a place so peaceful and pleasant I spent the night. The dripping and bubbling of tiny seeps and springs through soft green moss beside the trail was as good as music, and finally arriving at the clear, flowing waters of Tank Seven Creek was like entering the land of plenty.</p>
				<p>Tank Seven Creek was where I met Victor Hanson-Smith, trail name &ldquo;Flamingo,&rdquo; a Continental Divide hiker who was taking a break from the trail to cook an early dinner before walking into the evening. Victor told me he was a scientist. He&rsquo;d taken an unpaid leave of absence to walk the divide and had started in Glacier National Park in late June. Now, 2,000 miles later, he was getting ready to enter the San Juans.</p>
				<p>Victor was the first divide hiker that I&rsquo;d found sitting still. Most are walking. Fast. Making time, making distance, hurrying between snow melt and snow&rsquo;s arrival. Divide hikers travel early, before light, and go all day into the dusk.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m continually impressed with divide hikers. I&rsquo;ve put in 300 miles, so multiply that by five ... I can&rsquo;t imagine where that puts a person mentally and physically. So I asked.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I have had my moments," he said. "Why am I doing this. Why not just go home. Why not just quit. Sometimes it was a struggle. But now it&rsquo;s like my mind is detached from my body. I&rsquo;m like an observer of myself. I can walk uphill, downhill, rain, snow, wind, sun, whatever, and my body just does it. Just walks. Every so often my mind checks in with my body and it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re still walking. Okay.&rsquo; And then my mind goes back to thinking about whatever it is that I&rsquo;m thinking about or looking at.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Dinner finished, Flamingo packed up his gear while I set up my tarp. &ldquo;I can get a few more miles in before dark,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe even do some night hiking.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The next day, I made the long climb up from Tank Seven Creek to Marshall Pass. When I got to the trailhead at Marshall Pass, a man sitting in a lawn chair beside a campfire yelled to ask if I wanted a beer. Why hell yes, I said, I&rsquo;d love a beer. And how about some peanut M&M&rsquo;s, the stranger asked, opening up a big bag for me. Damn, man. Yes I would.</p>
				<p>You sticking around, the stranger asked, camping here?</p>
				<p>Nope, I replied. I&rsquo;m moving on. And into the evening I walked.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Wild weather, big climbs and a companion in the Collegiate West</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Sept. 11, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> storm was brewing on the Continental Divide. Leaden clouds enveloped the tops of the big peaks and ridges, pouring like wraiths down their flanks. A cold wind rose carrying the scent of something wet. Maybe rain, maybe snow. Maybe both. </p>
				<p>Stars had been out all night, and the dawn had been clear. But now, at 9 a.m., the weather had already deteriorated into something messy and potentially scary.</p>

				<p>In front of us a wide, barren slope pocked with rock and covered by tundra stretched for a half-mile or more towards a narrow saddle. We needed to get over the saddle and down the other side to a stream for water.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to make it,&rdquo; said my friend Tom Brown, who was hiking this stretch of the Collegiate West section of The Colorado Trail along with me.</p>
				<p>Was he just talking about getting over the ridge without getting rain-soaked, or something more sinister?</p>
				<p>Our situation had changed so quickly that we were just as vulnerable standing there as we were climbing. A retreat back down to treeline would cost us 1,000 hard-won vertical feet. Unthinkable.</p>
				<p>So we moved forward. It is an extreme act of faith to go walking up into a high, barren place covered by dark clouds. After a month of hiking The Colorado Trail solo, I was glad not to be doing it alone.</p>
				<p>But it was more than just wanting some companionship on the trail that gladdened my heart. Of all the parts of The Colorado Trail that I have walked this summer, the Collegiate West has become my favorite. There are some parts of the trail that are excellent to savor alone, and there are some where it&rsquo;s nice to have a friend along. Especially if that friend is a good mountaineer and handy with a map and compass.</p>
				<p>I had walked the first half of the Collegiate West, from Twin Lakes to Cottonwood Pass, solo. I knew that the second half would be even more beautiful, remote and challenging.</p>

				<p>Recently completed (in 2014) and still being constructed and rerouted and improved upon, the Collegiate West stretches for 80 miles, from the tiny town of Twin Lakes to U.S. 50 on Monarch Pass &mdash; and it is one spectacular and thrilling hike.</p>
				<p>For most of its length, the Collegiate West travels along the Continental Divide, undulating down the spine of the high, rugged Collegiate mountain range for which it is named. The trail rarely dips below 11,000 feet and mostly hovers around 12,000 feet, rising on occasion to nearly 13,000 feet.</p>
				<p>This is vast, high alpine country dominated by a sea of mountains that includes 11 of Colorado&rsquo;s fourteeners. It&rsquo;s liberally sprinkled with numerous lesser, but no less dramatic, towers of rock and slopes of scree. Wild, nameless streams pour and roar in silver ribbons down mountainsides here, into even wilder basins. Everywhere there are tracks of elk, moose and bighorn sheep, the grasses pressed to the earth by their beds.</p>
				<p>The Collegiate West is a place of big climbs and big descents. Up-up-up you climb, and then down-down-down, and then you do it all over again. And the weather in the Collegiates, Tom Brown and I decided, just happens all around us, all the time, always changing.</p>
				<p>As we moved up the saddle we kept a constant eye on the weather. Though the storm enveloped us all that day, blustery and sometimes noisy, not a drop of rain fell on us until evening, after we&rsquo;d already pitched the tarp and cooked our dinner.</p>
				<p>That night the sky opened and lightning flashes illuminated the tarp. In the morning there would be another stiff climb up another saddle, and there would be weather. But we&rsquo;d get to spend another day in the Collegiate West, and dawn, whether cloudy or clear, would be just another prelude to a beautiful, wild surprise.</p>

				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Collegiate West is a relatively new addition to The Colorado Trail. This 80-mile stretch roughly parallels the main route as it winds through the high, rugged terrain of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness north of Twin Lakes. Dean skipped ahead to this section of trail to cover its higher reaches before the snow sets in. He ran into few hikers until his friend Tom Brown joined him for the southern portion of the route.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Alone in the Collegiate Peaks: big country, big mental hurdles</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Sept. 1, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Buena Vista &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a month on The Colorado Trail, I&rsquo;ve seen some things.</p>
				<p>I watched a leaping weasel chase a butterfly through a flower-speckled meadow. I&rsquo;ve listened to baby bighorn sheep baa-ing in their nursery high in the crags. I&rsquo;ve lunched with a moose, had an elk bed down near my tent, been serenaded by coyotes.</p>
				<p>I wake up excited for what each new day brings, and even when I&rsquo;m slogging up a muddy trail or another pass, I feel blessed.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>I listen to my body and my intuition. I know when to take the pack off and shelter up ahead of a rain. I find myself feeling the wind, studying clouds and the trail for moose (lots), cat (one) or bear (zero) tracks, and other humans. There were many until I skipped ahead to the Collegiate West. Now, there are few.</p>
				<p>A month in, I get into one of my resupply boxes and I wonder what idiot packed it. (Me!) I&rsquo;m not in love with some of the meals I thought I&rsquo;d be in love with when I was planned out my food. But all the gear has worked out.</p>
				<p>When the overnight rain drops were frozen on the tent one recent morning, well, that was a little scary. Winter&rsquo;s coming. A chain of friends got my heavy duty bivy bag and wind pants to me over the weekend. A good thing. The season for the rain kilt and lightweight mosquito bivy is over.</p>
				<p>Gear, cold, food &mdash; that&rsquo;s all manageable. The toughest thing has been going it alone.</p>

				<p>Each section of The Colorado Trail has had it&rsquo;s own special challenges, but the Collegiate West has, so far, presented me with the most mental gymnastics.</p>
				<p>The Collegiates are my favorite mountain range in Colorado. They&rsquo;re just the way mountains should be: dense and steep, with sharp, craggy peaks that brush the sky and spear the clouds, with passes higher than the tallest mountains in many other ranges. There&rsquo;s running water everywhere. You don&rsquo;t cross streams on bridges on the Collegiate West. You ford them. And the woods and meadows are populated by all kinds of critters.</p>
				<p>The Collegiate West is a lonely place, in the way that a wild place should be lonely. I miss sharing things with someone else. There&rsquo;s no one to say, &ldquo;Hey, look at that!&rdquo; No one to discuss dinner decisions with. No one to make weather speculations with or to puzzle over strange forks in the trail with. There&rsquo;s no one to share in the misery of wet socks and wet shoes and a cold morning start. You get the picture.</p>
				<p>There used to be other hikers on the trail to socialize with and catch up on the news with. Not now. There&rsquo;s no one to ask about anything and no one to blame for anything. Just me. I&rsquo;m the only one out here.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Being alone it&rsquo;s hard to self-motivate, to get up and get going. Truthfully, some mornings I just want to lay wrapped in the warmth of the sleeping bag.</p>
				<p>Keep moving. That&rsquo;s my mantra, rain or shine, long or short, slow or fast. Keep moving. Except when it&rsquo;s time to nap.</p>
				<p>Not everyone that sets out from Denver to Durango or vice versa finishes the trail. When I land in a town, I hear news about people I met along the way leaving the trail. There&rsquo;s all kinds of obstacles on the trail, and not all of them of the wild variety. Blisters, dehydration, medical and family emergencies, cold, heat, burnout, loneliness, sickness. All take their toll on hikers.</p>
				<p>I give myself permission to turn back, to hike out to a road and take the big hitch back to Denver every day. And by doing so, I also give myself permission to go on.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Soothing the moose: Strange encounters on Snow Mesa</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Aug. 25, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Dean Krakel</p>

				<p class="dateline">Gunnison &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> hiker came dancing out of the woods, face aglow, eyes shining. Like a mirage. Stopping in front of me she proceeded to stretch out one leg and then the other.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t used to need to do that when I was younger.&rdquo; </p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="large-12 large-centered medium-12 medium-centered small-12 columns">

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling any of this spritely love for the trail. I&rsquo;d had a hard time hitching a ride out of Lake City to the trailhead on Spring Creek Pass. I was starting up the foreboding Snow Mesa at 3 p.m., much later than I&rsquo;d intended. My pack was heavy with resupply, the trail was steep, it was hot and the biting flies were hungry. I felt like the Tin Man nervously approaching The Wizard of Oz.</p>
				<p>Snow Mesa had me intimidated. It&rsquo;s is a formidable piece of country, a high, treeless expanse, seven miles long and just as wide, all above 12,000 feet. The Mesa was all that stood between me and the comforting protection of the heavily forested La Garita Wilderness.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going up there this late, are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I am,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m feeling pretty insecure about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Naw, I wouldn&rsquo;t go. What I&rsquo;d do is take a siesta for a couple of hours, wake up, check it out. You do not want to be caught up there in a storm, and it looks like somethings brewing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down. I&rsquo;m in the trees. I made it across. I&rsquo;m a happy girl!&rdquo; With that she skipped away.</p>
				<p>OK, nap time. I rambled around in the woods until I found a nice flat place between two young pines to take a much needed siesta. But I took too long of a snooze. A rumble of thunder and raindrops woke me. It was getting dark, so I decided to stay put. I settled in and felt content. I was alone, out of the hustle and bustle of Lake City and back in the mountains, back on the trail!</p>
				<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Suddenly a tiny owl flew past my head, close enough to make me duck, then swooshed by again. And again. Then it lit on the branch of a fallen tree and we stared at each other, no more than 10 yards apart. Finally the owl must have grown weary of the game because it flew off into the night.</p>
				<p>That&rsquo;s when the rain began. A pouring, drenching deluge that ran in rivulets down through the pines, soaking my sleeping bag from the bottom up. Thunder rumbled and lightning streaked overhead. Not such a charming little bivouac now.</p>
				<p>When dawn came, the sky was clear. Throwing all my wet stuff into a garbage bag, I packed up and dashed toward Snow Mesa.</p>
				<p>In that crisp early morning light, with a big blue sky stretching out overhead, Snow Mesa was one of the most beautiful places on The Colorado Trail. So huge, so green, so sprinkled with flowers, I wanted to throw off my pack, take off my shoes and run across its lush carpet out of sheer joy.</p>

				<p>By 10 a.m. a few clouds had puffed up overhead. Nice cotton balls. No worries! Larger clouds loomed over the mountains in the distance. The day was young yet! I stopped and had a late breakfast, emptied my pack and spread everything out in the sun to dry. Soon, according to the map, I&rsquo;d be in trees.</p>
				<p>But Snow Mesa can be deceptive. Across the main mesa, there&rsquo;s still a big chunk of above-treeline to navigate, and wide-open tundra saddles to climb and descend. And it was while I was walking up one of those saddles that the wind came up. A big wind.</p>
				<p>Suddenly the sky turned grey and my whole body hummed with alarm. I began moving as fast as I could, breathing like Darth Vader, heart hammering in my chest. Topping the last saddle I spotted trees below. Trees! I practically ran to them, trekking poles clicking off the rocks ahead of me for balance, the sky bubbling wickedly overhead.</p>
				<p>A crack of thunder overhead nearly drove me to the ground just as I hit the timber. The sky opened up. I stopped just long enough to pull out my umbrella and then I moved as fast as I could, jumping under the boughs of the first tree that I could fit under. The sky was dumping buckets. It began hailing. I hadn&rsquo;t even had time to take my pack off and dig out my rain gear, and I was getting soaked despite the umbrella and the pine boughs overhead.</p>

				<p>I must have felt that I was being watched, because I decided to look back over my right shoulder. Not 20 paces away stood a cow moose, her sleek brown coat wet and shining. A tiny calf sheltered under her bulk, wobbling on unsteady hooves. The calf couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a few days old. Uh oh.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey baby,&rdquo; I said in my calmest, coolest moose-soothing voice.</p>
				<p>The cow watched me intently, nostrils expanding and contracting as she breathed. OK. Lightning, rain and hail, or a disturbed mama moose?</p>
				<p>I stepped out into the rain and scurried further down the trail until I found a flat spot, an old camp, big enough that I could throw off my pack, pull out the tent, which dang, had just dried, finally. I pitched the tent, threw everything but my metal poles inside, zipped it up tight, squatted on my insulated ground pad and let the storm rage all around me for the next two hours.</p>
				<p>Sometimes it sounded as if I was underneath a jet airplane. The wind roared, the rain and hail pounded, the ground shook and the tent flapped and rattled, but I was happy. I was in the trees! I was among things taller than me! I&rsquo;d made it across Snow Mesa. I was done with the nerve-wracking tundra walking.</p>
				<p>Or so I thought.</p>

				<p class="dateline">Spring Creek Pass, Lake City &mdash; </p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ikers call it the &ldquo;30-mile tundra,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful and feared sections of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>Segments 22-24 stretch along the spine of the San Juan Mountains from Molas Pass to San Luis Pass (for northbound hikers, like me) &mdash; a lot of mileage. Fifty miles, if you add it up, but people call it 30. You can&rsquo;t get any higher or wilder in Colorado than the Continental Divide. You&rsquo;re rolling along between 12,000 and 13,000 feet for days at a time and up there, in the boiling storm clouds hovering in the peaks. Up there is where the lightning god lives. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. There are no trees. There is no cover. You are the tallest thing in the boulder-pocked green. You are the lightning rod.</p>
				<p>All the way up the crazy-steep climb along roaring Elk Creek to its headwaters on the Divide, in the rains and the mists ghosting among the peaks and lush forests of the Weminuche Wilderness, I kept asking other hikers I met about what was ahead, what was it like up there, how did they handle it, and the answer was always the same: something along the lines of, &ldquo;dude, we got lucky.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We ran 20 miles,&rdquo; said Rafikki, who was hiking with Wildflower and Breeze. &ldquo;We got a window in the weather and we went for it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; said Steamer with a shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything about it. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do. Find some low depression and wait it out and hope it&rsquo;s not your time I guess.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Not comforting. Not comforting at all. My mind was racing as I toiled up the trail under a heavy  load &mdash; because I&rsquo;d just resupplied in Silverton, and it had rained all night the night before, and I&rsquo;d packed the tent and the rain fly wet in the interest of speed. </p>
				<p>By the time I finished the final million switchbacks to the Divide I had pretty well inventoried everything that could possibly go wrong. It&rsquo;s well known that to avoid death by lightning in the Colorado high country, you get up and off the top by noon, because storms usually happen later in the day &mdash; usually. OK. But what if you couldn&rsquo;t get up and down by noon? What if when you got to the top, that&rsquo;s all there is? And what if you have to be on top for days? And what if you were carrying lots of metal: hiking poles, tent poles, stakes, umbrella, the eyelets in my gaiters, African bracelet, knife. Fillings. Sheesh. I was practically a metal magnet. </p>
				<p>So I&rsquo;d worked myself into a good state by the time I reached the top, at 12,000 feet. Wind-whipped clouds swirled above me and all around. On every horizon were clouds of every description and temperament: wind shredded wisps and mare&rsquo;s tails, black and grey thunderheads, white cotton puff balls. Storms flickered across distant peaks. I pulled down the hood of my rain shell so I could hear better. What was that? Thunder? No, a high flying jet. Was that a high flying jet? No. It&rsquo;s thunder. Distant. But still. Thunder is thunder.</p>
				<p>And so I began walking. Fast. Always studying the sky. Always looking for a low depression I could squeeze into. A place among the rocks where I wasn&rsquo;t the highest point in the landscape. A ravine I could sprint down. A cliff I could jump off. Yikes! It was nerve-wracking. I thought about turning back. I don&rsquo;t have to do this. I thought about the lightning storm I was in last year while I was doing the Collegiate East and West trails, how I threw off my pack and tossed my poles away from me and squatted on my haunches while the storm raged overhead and I, who do not pray, was moved to prayer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be such a better person. I&rsquo;ll be so good. I&rsquo;ll turn a new leaf. I&rsquo;ll give money to hospitals and orphanages and the homeless. Just let me through this one please.&rdquo; And I thought about Pounce and Helicopter, two Continental Divide hikers who&rsquo;d been caught in the same storm, only much higher, on Hope Pass. By the time they reached their resupply in the tiny town of Twin Lakes, Colorado, Pounce was in tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve walked all the way from Mexico. I just want to go to Canada,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;</p>

				</div>
				<p>After a time that first day I began to relax. I couldn&rsquo;t remain in such a high state of vigilance, so aware, all my senses humming at full alert. I started to enjoy the flowers. I stopped to take pictures of the clouds. I studied the rocks. I looked at elk tracks and laughed at the goofy marmots who always seemed to be caught napping along the sides of the trail. The tall rock cairns built as trail markers became a strange sort of company, like rock people, a sign not only showing the way but a sign that others had been here. Many others. A lot of others before me, and so far as I knew, not one of them had died in that high, lonely environment.</p>
				<p>That night, with my tent pitched next to a tiny stream trickling out of a snowbank, was the first time in my Colorado Trail journey that I had no cellphone coverage. Before then I&rsquo;d been able to turn my phone on at night and reach out and touch people to let them know I was alright. Now, for the next eight days I would have no contact. I was truly on my own. Alone. And it felt good.</p>
				<p>While I was Silverton, during my resupply I called Laine Walter, blind hiker Trevor Thomas&rsquo;s friend and supporter. We were chatting away, I was sorting out food and feeling lazy, like maybe I could spend another zero day just hanging out, when suddenly Laine blurted out. &ldquo;You have to move. You have to take whatever window of opportunity opens and you have to go with it. You have to keep moving. That&rsquo;s the name of the game in long-distance hiking. Move, Dean!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I thought about those words over and over again in the 30-mile-tundra. I learned how eat breakfast, doctor my blisters and pack my tent from the inside out. I learned to pack and separate wet gear, and when was a good time to stop and dry all that gear. I learned when was a good time to nap or rest or eat. What clouds to watch. What winds to keep track of. I learned how to be my own best company. But most of all I learned how to move, and how to keep moving no matter what the weather was doing, or how I felt about things.</p>
				<p>And that is how I got across the 30-mile-tunda.</p>

				<h2 class="bloghead">Some thru-hikers counted on Animas River for water</h2>
				<p class="published">Published Aug. 13, 2015</p>
				<p class="byline centered">By Jenn Fields</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ean called from Lake City on Wednesday afternoon with updates from his trek across what Colorado Trail hikers call the 30-Mile Tundra. (We&rsquo;ll have a longer post from Dean on that soon.)</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, after Dean departed from Silverton last week, he crossed the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28595759/animas-river-contaminated-by-1-million-gallons-contaminated">Animas River shortly after the mining-waste spill there</a> via a bridge on the trail. He described the river as &ldquo;red&rdquo; when he came upon it and was alarmed to see another backpacker filtering water from the river.</p>
				<p>Another Colorado Trail thru-hiker told Dean that she&rsquo;d been counting on the Animas as a water source and broke down in tears when she came upon the orange-colored river, which <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28629387/colo-state-health-dept-says-animas-water-ok">the EPA now says is safe for drinking water treatment facilities</a>.</p>

				<p class="dateline">Silverton &mdash;</p>
				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> load of backpackers in the bed of a pickup yelled and waved their hiking poles at me as I walked up the main drag this afternoon. People I&rsquo;ve met on the trail? Maleck, Jet,  Captain Yams or Woolly Booger? Maybe Bojangles or Mercury? Not sure. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the general &ldquo;yahoo!&rdquo; feeling of Colorado Trail energy that has infused this part of the state.</p>
				<p>Hikers are everywhere. On the trail, I meet at least a dozen fellow Colorado Trail travelers every day, except for the one day I didn&rsquo;t meet anyone. Off the trail, they&rsquo;re walking the streets in Durango and Silverton, Salida and Buena Vista, standing by the highway with their thumbs out, turning their pockets inside out at the grocery stores, slamming down cold beers in the bars and wolfing down steaks and burgers in the restaurants.</p>
				<p>Andy Hanahan III, owner of the Prospector Motel, where I stayed in Silverton, caters to hikers. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I cater to the hikers?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just look around. They&rsquo;re everywhere. The Colorado Trail has been a tremendous boon to towns like Silverton. I don&rsquo;t know why more businesses don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Hanahan takes resupply boxes, drives us to trailheads and the laundromat, does fresh coffee in the rooms. Fresh coffee, not packets, in his in-room coffee makers! He knows hikers crave the fresh buna. I know I did. One of the things I forgot to pack was coffee.</p>
				<p>Um, yeah. All that planning and no coffee. It was on my mind. But like a lot of things in the final haste to just get moving and out on the trail, coffee got left behind. Haste also cost me $169 for speeding outside of Montrose. &ldquo;But sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on The Colorado Trail in the morning. I have to get to Durango.&rdquo; Officer didn&rsquo;t think that was much of an excuse. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have broken the law,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>So how has it gone, this first week, aside from forgetting the coffee and getting a speeding ticket? A first week of backpacking is always a shakedown. I do believe that hikers starting their trip in Denver have a bit of advantage: a slower, lower start, a nice rolling trail for 70 miles before it starts the first real climb up Georgia Pass. Starting from Durango, at 6,512 feet in elevation, you begin climbing immediately and you don&rsquo;t stop until you get over the fierce, frighteningly beautiful Indian Trail Ridge at 12,338 feet.</p>
				<p>The pack is getting organized. I can&rsquo;t find things in the tent at night. I&rsquo;m still gaining my trail legs and lungs. But I&rsquo;m much stronger than last year. Much. I&rsquo;m not bounding like a bighorn up the trail just yet, but all the high-mileage hikers I meet assure me that in time that will come. Yeah! Until then, I&rsquo;m a 10-mile-a-day guy. Fast or slow, I go 10 miles. My mornings (I&rsquo;m on the trail by 7 a.m.) start out fabulous and degenerate by afternoon. And I think some of that is due to nutrition. </p>
				<p>Yup. The subject I devoted the most time and planning to has turned out to be the most flawed. I blame pemmican.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The pemmican I had such high hopes for &mdash; it was supposed to be breakfast and lunch, I made 24 pounds of the stuff over the winter, it was going to be my go-to energy source, my miracle food) &mdash; is a bust. The truth is, when all was said and done, I just can&rsquo;t eat it steady and straight. Pemmican is wonderful when thrown into boiling water and mixed with macaroni in the evening. A calorie bomb. But on it&rsquo;s own? Give me peanut butter and cheese and eggs.</p>
				<p>A hard confession. I am, after all, the Pemmican God of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>The other thing about pemmican is that in bear country &hellip; well, pemmican is meat and fat, and hey, bears are all about meat and fat. If you&rsquo;re a mountain man with a Hawkins rifle you can guard your pemmican. But me? I had a bear walk through my camp one night and all I had was my umbrella. While it&rsquo;s true that bears are scared to death of umbrellas, I don&rsquo;t want to make a habit of testing the limits of the power of the umbrella. So I&rsquo;m leaving the pemmican behind here in Silverton.</p>
				<p>Pemmican isn&rsquo;t taking all the blame here &mdash; I expected to make more distance than I am. For the next section of trail, the 53 miles from Molas Pass to Spring Creek Pass, I had budgeted food for three-and-a-half days. When my former wife Alisa (who has graciously done my Lake City to Salida resupply) reminded me that it took us eight days to do that stretch back in the &rsquo;90s, and that there is a lot of climbing involved, I just laughed it off. Ha, ha, ha. I am nearly two decades older now, but hey, so much stronger! Right. After a week on the trail, I thought better of that three-and-a-half-day estimation, and that&rsquo;s why I headed into Silverton to buy food. I am beefing up that resupply to seven days of food, including a layover day, and I&rsquo;m fortifying my resupplies in a likewise manner all along my route.</p>
				<p>All the equipment has worked out. I had my doubts about the rain kilt, especially when it was storming so hard as I came up Kennebec Pass that rain was blowing up my cuben fiber skirt. But hey, how often does that happen? In a straight, steady downpour it works, but I do miss my long rain pants. Maybe it&rsquo;s a guy thing. The umbrella? Priceless. Not only does it shed rain, it acts as a windbreak. I curled up behind it beneath a pine once and slept out a storm. And it&rsquo;s been storming a lot. The last night before I hitched into Silverton, camped above Hotel Draw, was the first night in a week without thunder and rain. Storms forced me to do a zero day &mdash; no miles &mdash; last Sunday beneath Indian Trail Ridge. One gust of wind on Sunday night shook the tent so hard that I thought a moose (there were tracks in the trail) was assaulting me. Everybody knows moose hate tents. Right? </p>
				<p>So it&rsquo;s been shakedown and shake-it-up and get-in-tune week. But what&rsquo;s the trail like? I am surrounded by fantastic scenery every minute of every day. On the rainy, cloudy days, mist blows like smoke across the mountain peaks. On the sunny days the skies are the deepest, purest blue.The flowers are like being inside a kaleidoscope. Despite the blisters (I have two), I love moving through this landscape. I feel happy and alive and grateful. And I&rsquo;ve met some wonderful people. Everyone I meet is going south, and this far south, they are close to the end of their Colorado Trail trip, and they are glowing and wild eyed and filled with the good energy of the mountains.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t&rsquo;s been hurry-up-and-wait mode on The Colorado Trail for a few days.</p>
				<p>This morning, Dean headed out under somewhat clear skies to dash across the exposed Indian Trail Ridge in Segment 27.</p>
				<p>With the San Juans somewhat socked in over the weekend, Dean got stuck high on the trail waiting for storms to clear out enough for safe crossing through this above-treeline section of The Colorado Trail.</p>
				<p>Here&rsquo;s an Aug. 1 update from Dean:</p>
				<p><i>Storms have me stalled out between Kennebec Pass and Indian Trail Ridge. The ridge is a narrow, long passage, and a storm magnet, and another big climb. I was up at 5:30 a.m. hoping to miss the rain, but by the time I got to the top at 11,700, it was raining so hard and blowing so bad that rain was blowing up the rain kilt, and I had to hold tight on the umbrella. So I made an early camp.</i></p>
				<p><i>I had to dry things out. My feet are so wet they&rsquo;re wrinkled as if I&rsquo;ve been swimming. And now I&rsquo;m going to cook something hot. Thank you, Mr. Stove. Breathtaking scenery. I&rsquo;m also charging the phone. Legs are good but tired today.</i></p>
				<p>He reported in early Aug. 2:</p>
				<p><i>Stayin&rsquo; put. It&rsquo;s ugly out already. Sounds like a distant bombardment.</i></p>
				<p>Early on Aug. 3, he sent a sunny trail photo and said:</p>
				<p><i>I&rsquo;m on the move.</i></p>
				<p>A couple of hours later, he posted on <a href="https://instagram.com/p/57Vze-h23l/">Instagram that he&rsquo;d made it across</a>.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he minute you start thinking about thru-hiking the trail, you have to start thinking about resupply. Your resupply determines what kind of food you&rsquo;re going to make, how durable it is, how long it lasts. Then you have to decide whether to mail resupply boxes or drop them off yourself &mdash; that&rsquo;s what I chose to do, because you can&rsquo;t mail butane canisters.</p>
				<p>Calculating the food you take on the trail and your resupplies has to be done carefully. Are you going to arrive at a resupply empty? That&rsquo;s my goal. For the longer stretches between towns and resupplies, I hope I&rsquo;ve figured that right.</p> 
				<p>Here&rsquo;s my resupply plan &mdash; and remember I&rsquo;m starting in Durango &mdash; with some trail description along the way.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 28-25:</span> This stretch goes from the start at Junction Creek in Durango and travels 73.9 miles to Molas Pass, on U.S. 550. My resupply will be at Little Molas Lake campground, or Silverton. It is a frontier for me &mdash; I&rsquo;ve not seen it in any of my previous Colorado Trail hikes. It climbs into the San Juan Mountains, above treeline. This stretch is high and exposed and I&rsquo;ll need to move fast to avoid storms. I won&rsquo;t have my trail legs yet, and pack organization will be sketchy for a few days. This is a country of big sweeping views and the flowers should be outrageously beautiful. I expect this stretch to take five days.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 24-22:</span> From Molas Pass, The Colorado Trail travels 53.3 miles to Spring Creek Pass, through more wide-open country at high elevation. In these segments the trail crosses Coney Summit, which is over 13,000 feet and thus the highest point on the Colorado Trail. My resupply will be in Lake City; I&rsquo;ll hitch 17 miles on Colorado 149 to get there. I&rsquo;ve been over this section before, long ago, not long after The Colorado Trail was completed. What I remember most is that there weren&rsquo;t any other hikers in eight days of traveling. My other big memory is of one of the worst lightning storms I&rsquo;ve ever been caught in outdoors. Travel time: 3-4 days.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 21-15:</span> Spring Creek Pass to U.S. 50. This is a long section, 105 miles, and the furthest distance between resupply points. There&rsquo;s simply nowhere to resupply, unless you walk to Creede (which is out of the way), or a friend resupplies by Jeep at Bear Town, a ghost town, or at the Eddiesville trailhead. This section is also one of the most beautiful on the entire Colorado Trail. The above-treeline expanse of Snow Mesa is one of the highlights and one of the most exposed places on the trail. The Colorado Trail also crosses the Durango/Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad tracks at Elk Park. The trail climbs up past the peaks of the Grenadier Range, paralleling Elk Creek to the divide, plunges down to Bear Town, crosses the Rio Grande and travels through the lowlands of the Cochetopa Hills before climbing up to Marshall Pass and U.S. 50 &hellip; where in my case, a friend will be waiting with a resupply box. Otherwise, with some planning, you could hitch a ride on the train to Silverton or Durango.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 14-11:</span> U.S. 50 to Twin Lakes is a 76-mile stretch that I originally had broken into two portions: one resupply at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs, which is right on The Colorado Trail, and another at Twin Lakes, the crossroad for all Colorado Trail and Continental Divide hikers. I&rsquo;ve combined this resupply into one drop at Twin Lakes. There&rsquo;s not much in Twin Lakes, but it&rsquo;s a bright-enough spot for a person that&rsquo;s been backpacking for awhile, and the general store will hold hiker packages. This stretch spends a lot of time in beautiful pine and aspen forests. It does make a steep ascent across the shoulder of Mt. Yale. Looking forward to a soak in the Mt. Princeton Hot Springs.</p>

								<p class="cutline">A perfect pemmican loaf fresh from the lab. Pemmican consists of dried meat, tallow and berries. Pemmican lasts forever without refrigeration and is light and nutrient dense. This two pound loaf probably contains close to 8,000 calories. <span class="photog">Dean Krakel, Special to The Denver Post</span></p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Collegiate West:</span> The Collegiate West trail is 80 miles long and was just completed in 2014. A high route along the Continental Divide. I&rsquo;ll probably walk this from Twin Lakes and go south, crossing Lake Creek on the bridge at the Little Willis Gulch Trailhead two miles west of Twin Lakes along Highway 82. Last year I lost a day trying to ford Lake Creek at &ldquo;the ford.&rdquo; The creek was in flood from all the rain and I spent a lot of time thrashing up and down along the bank trying to figure out a way across. Then a mountain biker told me about the bridge a couple of miles upstream. Duh. The trail climbs up Hope Pass &mdash; you hope you never have to carry a pack up it again &mdash; and then spills down Sheep Gulch. Then it climbs up Lake Ann Pass. And down Lake Ann Pass. Then up Cottonwood Pass&hellip; You get the picture. Up and down but mostly up. The trail crosses Cottonwood Pass and eventually ends at Highway 50. I&rsquo;ll need two resupplies here. One at the beginning, at Twin Lakes and one at the end, which will probably be in the grocery store in Salida after a hitch into town.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 10-7:</span> Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, near Leadville, to Breckenridge. I&rsquo;m undecided about my resupply here. Tennessee Pass is a good place to meet someone. Leadville isn&rsquo;t terribly far away, but going there still eats up valuable time. With no resupply at the pass or in Leadville, the next feasible stop is Breckenridge, 72 miles away. Breckenridge sits right on The Colorado Trail. Although I&rsquo;ve been from Twin Lakes to Tennessee Pass, I&rsquo;ve not been through the country from there to Kokomo and Searle passes, and I&rsquo;ve not been from Searle Pass to Breckenridge, which involves a high crossing of the Ten Mile Range. The Holy Cross Wilderness is a beautiful highlight on this section, and the trail also passes through the old army training post, Camp Hale, where the 10th Mountain Division honed their skills during World War II.</p>

				<p><span class="ledein">Segments 6-1:</span> Breckenridge to Denver, 105 miles. The home stretch! I may resupply in Jefferson, on U.S. 285 here, or at Kenosha Pass. Although I&rsquo;ve only been from Breckenridge to Georgia Pass once, and that was on a mountain bike, I&rsquo;ve snowshoed and skied and run and biked and hiked all of the trails from Georgia Pass back to Denver, so this is familiar country. After climbing up and over Georgia Pass and then Kenosha Pass, the trail travels through amazing aspen and pine forest, including through the old Hayman fire burn area &mdash; a hot, dry, waterless chunk of trail. After crossing the North Fork of the South Platte River on the Gudy Gaskill bridge (hey, I&rsquo;m almost home), The Colorado Trail makes a short climb and then a short downhill that leads to the flat old road of Waterton Canyon and the northern terminus of the trail.
